AB  - BACKGROUND: Many hypertensive patients discontinue drug therapy despite the increased cardiovascular risk associated with inadequately controlled hypertension. However, most experiments do not address this premature discontinuation of therapy, making it difficult to project the appropriateness of antihypertensive drugs in real-world use. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess patients' persistence with antihypertensive drug therapy in a nonexperimental setting. METHODS: An administrative database kept by the Local Health Unit of Ravenna, Ravenna, Italy, listing patient baseline characteristics, drug prescriptions, and hospital admissions was used to perform a population-based, retrospective study. The study included all patients who met the following criteria from January I through December 31, 1997: new user of antihypertensive drugs; > or = 20 years of age; receiving a first prescription for a diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin II-receptor antagonist (AIIA), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. All prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs filled during the 12-month follow-up period were used to define patients as continuers, switchers, or discontinuers on the basis of their persistence with therapy. RESULTS: A total of 16,783 patients were included in the study analyses: 7,409 men (44.1%) and 9,374 women (55.9%), with an average age of 56.1 +/- 18.3 years (range, 20-105 years). Of this study population, 64.9% (n = 10,894) discontinued treatment over the course of follow-up, 26.9% (n = 4508) continued treatment with the initially prescribed medication (with 5.1% [n = 862] adding another medication for combination therapy), and 8.2% (n = 1381) switched medications. Patients initially prescribed AIIAs were more likely to continue treatment than those initiated on other types of antihypertensives (P < 0.001). Discontinuation was associated with younger age, lower prevalence of concurrent chronic pharmacotherapies, and lower prevalence of previous hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Health care claims data are a powerful tool for measuring continuation of therapy, providing detailed, populationwide epidemiologic and economic information for analyzing antihypertensive drug treatment. Further studies are required to relate pharmacotherapy to outcomes.

AB  - Hypertension is one of the most important causes of mortality, affecting the health status of the patient. At the same time, hypertension causes a huge health and economic burden on the whole world. The incidence and prevalence of hypertension are rising even among young people in both urban as well as rural communities. Although various conventional therapeutic moieties are available for the management of hypertension, they have serious flaws such as hepatic metabolism, reduced dose frequency, poor aqueous solubility, reduced bioavailability, and increased adverse effects, making the drug therapy ineffective. Therefore, it is required to design a novel drug delivery system having the capability to solve the constraints associated with conventional treatment of hypertension. Nanotechnology is a new way of using and manipulating the matter at the molecular level, whose functional organization is measured in nanometers. The applications of nanotechnology in the field of medicine provide an alternative and novel direction for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and show excellent performance in the field of targeted drug therapy. Various nanotechnologies based drug delivery systems, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanosuspension, nanoemulsion, liposome, self-emulsifying systems, and polymeric nanoparticles, are available. Among them, nanoemulsion has provided a niche to supplement currently available therapeutic choices due to numerous benefits like stability, ease of preparation, enhanced drug absorption, reduced hepatic metabolism, increased dose frequency, enhanced bioavailability, and encapsulation of hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic drugs. This present review provides an in-depth idea about progression in treatment of hypertension, constraints for antihypertensive drug therapy, need of nanoemulsions to overcome these constraints, comparative analysis of nanoemulsions over other nanostructure drug delivery systems, pharmacodynamics studies of nanoemulsions for treatment of hypertension, recent patents for drug-loaded nanoemulsions meant for hypertension, and marketed formulations of nanoemulsions for hypertension.

AB  - Purpose. The implementation and outcomes of a program combining electronic home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) and pharmacist-provided medication therapy management (MTM) services in a renal transplantation clinic are described. Summary. Patients enrolled in the program were provided with a computer-enabled blood pressure monitor. A dedicated renal transplantation pharmacist was integrated into the renal transplantation team under a collaborative care practice agreement. The collaborative care agreement allowed the pharmacist to authorize medication additions, deletions, and dosage changes. Comprehensive disease and blood pressure education was provided by a clinical pharmacist. In the pretrans-plantation setting, the pharmacist interviewed the renal transplant candidate and documents allergies, verified the patient's medication profile, and identified and assessed barriers to medication adherence. A total of 50 renal transplant recipients with at least one recorded home blood pressure reading and at least one year of follow-up were included in our analysis. A significant reduction in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were observed at 30, 90,180, and 360 days after enrollment in the program (p < 0.05). Pharmacist interventions were documented for 37 patients. Medication-related problems accounted for 46% of these interventions and included dosage modifications, regimen changes, and mitigation of barriers to medication access and adherence. Conclusion. Implementation of electronic HBPM and pharmacist-provided MTM services implemented in a renal transplant clinic was associated with sustained improvements in blood pressure control. Incorporation of a pharmacist in the renal transplant clinic resulted in the detection and resolution of medication-related problems.

AB  - PURPOSE: Adherence patterns of patients treated with a fixed-dose combination of amlodipine--benazepril versus an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB) prescribed as separate drugs were studied. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of pharmacy claims from a managed care organization in the northeastern United States, patients who received at least two prescriptions for fixed-dose amlodipine-benazepril (n = 2839) or at least two prescriptions for an ACE inhibitor plus a dihydropyridine CCB (n = 3367) were followed over one year. Adherence, defined as the medication possession ratio (MPR), was calculated based on daily possession of the prescribed drug or drugs over the study period. To estimate the impact of overall drug burden on adherence to antihypertensive therapy, concomitant medication use was calculated as the number of American Hospital Formulary Service (AHFS) drug classes prescribed. RESULTS: Adherence rates among patients receiving fixed-dose amlodipine--benazepril versus an ACE inhibitor plus a dihydropyridine CCB were 87.9% and 69.2%, respectively (p < 0.0001) over a mean follow-up of 259 and 247 days, respectively. Patients received a mean 4.0 major AHFS drug classes in the amlodipine-benazepril group and 5.2 in the ACE inhibitor plus dihydropyridine CCB group. As the number of concomitant drugs increased, the difference in the MPR between the two treatment groups increased in favor of fixed-dose amlodipine-benazepril. CONCLUSION: Fixed-dose amlodipine-benazepril was associated with higher adherence rates versus an ACE inhibitor plus a dihydropyridine CCB taken as two separate tablets, regardless of the number of concomitant medications prescribed.

AB  - Background: The impact of pharmacist-led transition of care services with collaborative drug therapy management has shown to improve patients' outcomes and decrease health costs. Compelling statistics show higher readmission rates for under-insured patients compared with insured patients at primary health care clinics. Methods: This is a single center, prospective, cohort study designed to examine team-based collaborative drug therapy management and its effect on therapeutic outcomes of under-insured patients with target chronic diseases managed in a primary health center. Targeted chronic diseases included dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, anticoagulation disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure. The primary outcome measures included percentage of time in therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) and percentage of patients at targeted goals of blood pressure, lipids, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes included reduced emergency department visits, number of patient encounters, hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge, and disease exacerbation rates. Results: Patients were at INR goal 58% of the time compared with 52% at baseline (P =.66). There was a 9% improvement in mean HbA1c in the intervention group when compared with baseline (9.6% vs 10.9%, P =.03). With pharmacist intervention, 73.8% of the patients had their blood pressure at goal compared with 50% at baseline (P =.14). A limited number of patients were readmitted for different reasons, including uncontrolled disease states. Conclusions: The pharmacist-physician collaborative drug therapy management led to improved blood pressure control, average HbA1c, and time in therapeutic INR range. A decrease in health care utilization was also identified.

AB  - Clinical practice often conflicts with epidemiologic evidence in the management of blood pressure. Antihypertensive therapy is generally prescribed if blood pressure exceeds some arbitrary level, thus committing many persons with minimal cardiovascular risk to long-term drug therapy. By contrast, below that level, regardless of cardiovascular risk, blood pressure reduction is rarely sought. Epidemiologic data, however, consistently show a continuous, positive, linear relationship of the height of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with the incidence of stroke and heart attack. No threshold level distinguishes those who will have a cardiovascular event from those who will not. In fact, most heart attacks and many strokes occur among persons with "normal" blood pressures. Observational experience suggests that benefit could be obtained from universal blood pressure reduction of even a few millimeters of mercury. This public health strategy can be augmented by identifying those individuals, at every level of blood pressure, whose risk for cardiovascular disease justifies the cost of pharmacologic intervention. Antihypertensive drug therapy will be most efficient and effective if directed at those who, by virtue of their constellation of risk factors or evidence of preclinical vascular disease, are likely to have a heart attack or stroke. The resulting redirection of clinical resources will spare many hypertensive persons whose absolute risk for a cardiovascular event is small, from life-long treatment. At the same time, other persons, currently classified as normotensive, will become candidates for blood pressure reduction because their cardiovascular risk is high.

AB  - Objectives: To (1) provide medication therapy management (MTM) services to patients, (2) measure the clinical effects associated with the provision of MTM services, (3) measure the percent of patients achieving Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) goals for hypertension and hyperlipidemia in the MTM services intervention group in relationship to a comparison group who did not receive MTM services, and (4) compare patients' total health expenditures for the year before and after receiving MTM services.Design: Prospective study.Setting: Six ambulatory clinics in Minnesota from August 1, 2001, to July 31, 2002.Patients: 285 intervention group patients with at least 1 of 12 medical conditions using prestudy health claims; 126 comparison group patients with hypertension and 126 patients with hyperlipidemia were selected among 9 clinics without MTM services for HEDIS analysis.Intervention: MTM services provided by pharmacists to BlueCross BlueShield health plan beneficiaries in collaboration with primary care providers.Main Outcome Measures: Drug therapy problems resolved; percentage of patients' goals of therapy achieved and meeting HEDIS measures for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Total health expenditures per person were measured for a 1-year period before and after enrolling patients in MTM services.Results: 637 drug therapy problems were resolved among 285 intervention patients, and the percentage of patients' goals of therapy achieved increased from 76% to 90%. HEDIS measures improved in the intervention group compared with the comparison group for hypertension (71% versus 59%) and cholesterol management (52% versus 30%). Total health expenditures decreased from $11,965 to $8,197 per person (n = 186, P < 0.0001). The reduction in total annual health expenditures exceeded the cost of providing MTM services by more than 12 to 1.Conclusion: Patients receiving face-to-face MTM services provided by pharmacists in collaboration with prescribers experienced improved clinical outcomes and lower total health expenditures. Clinical outcomes of MTM services have chronic care improvement and value-based purchasing implications, and economic outcomes support inclusion of MTM services in health plan design.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effectiveness and cost savings of a real-world, continuous, pharmacist-delivered service with an employed patient population with diabetes over a 5-year period.Setting: The Patients, Pharmacists Partnerships (P3 Program) was offered as an "opt-in" benefit to employees of 6 public and private self-insured employers in Maryland and Virginia. Care was provided in ZIP code-matched locations and at 2 employers' worksites.Practice Description: Six hundred two enrolled patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes were studied between July 2006 and May 2012 with an average follow-up of 2.5 years per patient. Of these patients, 162 had health plan cost and utilization data. A network of 50 trained pharmacists provided chronic disease management to patients with diabetes using a common process of care. Communications were provided to patients and physicians.Practice Innovation: Employers provided incentives for patients who opted in, including waived medication copayments and free diabetes self-monitoring supplies. The service was provided at no cost to the patient. A Web-based, electronic medical record that complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act helped to standardize care. Quality assurance was conducted to ensure the standard of care.Evaluation: Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c), blood pressure, and total health care costs (before and after enrollment).Results: Statistically significant improvements were shown by mean decreases in A1c (-0.41%, P <0.001), low-density lipoprotein levels (-4.7 mg/dL, P = 0.003), systolic blood pressure (-2.3 mm Hg, P = 0.001), and diastolic blood pressure (-2.4 mm Hg, P <0.001). Total annual health care costs to employers declined by $1031 per beneficiary after the cost of the program was deducted. This 66-month real-world study confirms earlier findings. Employers netted savings through improved clinical outcomes and reduced emergency and hospital utilization when comparing costs 12 months before and after enrollment.Conclusion: The P3 program had positive clinical outcomes and economic outcomes. Pharmacist-provided comprehensive medication therapy management services should be included as a required element of insurance offered by employers and health insurance exchanges.

AB  - Objectives: Uncontrolled hypertension is a common cause of cardiovascular disease, which is the deadliest and costliest chronic disease in the United States. Pharmacists are an accessible community healthcare resource and are equipped with clinical skills to improve the management of hypertension through medication therapy management (MTM). Nevertheless, current reimbursement models do not incentivize pharmacists to provide clinical services. We aim to investigate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist-led comprehensive MTM clinic compared with no clinic for 10-year primary prevention of stroke and cardiovascular disease events in patients with hypertension.Methods: We built a semi-Markov model to evaluate the clinical and economic consequences of an MTM clinic compared with no MTM clinic, from the payer perspective. The model was populated with data from a recently published controlled observational study investigating the effectiveness of an MTM clinic. Methodology was guided using recommendations from the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, including appropriate sensitivity analyses.Results: Compared with no MTM clinic, the MTM clinic was cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $38 798 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The incremental net monetary benefit was $993 294 considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY. Health-benefit benchmarks at $100 000 per QALY and $150 000 per QALY translate to a 95% and 170% increase from current reimbursement rates for MTM services.Conclusions: Our model shows current reimbursement rates for pharmacist-led MTM services may undervalue the benefit realized by US payers. New reimbursement models are needed to allow pharmacists to offer cost-effective clinical services.

AB  - Objective: This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine as monotherapy and in combination therapy in patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite pharmacologic treatment.Methods: This observational, open, prospective, parallel, controlled, multicenter, comparative, postmarketing drug surveillance study included hypertensive outpatients (systolic blood pressure [SBP] >/= 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] >/= 90 mm Hg) whose hypertension was uncontrolled despite pharmacologic treatment. Randomly selected primary care physicians chose the patients and assigned them to the group (amlodipine monotherapy or amlodipine as part of a 2-drug antihypertensive regimen) they considered more appropriate. Each patient was to have >/= 3 visits during the 4-month follow-up period. The initial dosage of amlodipine was 5 mg once daily; this dosage could be increased to 10 mg once daily to achieve control of hypertension. Main outcome measures included optimum and suboptimum control of hypertension and incidence of adverse events.Results: A total of 2628 patients (1838 [69.9%], amlodipine monotherapy; 790 [30.1%], combination therapy) participated in this study. Of these patients, 2406 had DBP >/= 90 mm Hg at baseline. Only 29 patients had DBP > 90 mm Hg and SBP < 140 mm Hg. By the end of the study, 28.6% of the 2442 patients for whom data were available had achieved the optimum therapeutic goal (SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg). A total of 156 patients (5.9%) experienced adverse events, 93.0% mild (edema, headache, flushing) and 7.0% serious. In 78.3% of cases the prescribing physician considered the adverse event to be related to treatment, but none of the 13 serious adverse events in 11 patients were considered to be related to amlodipine. No significant difference in the incidence of adverse events was found between the patients receiving monotherapy and those receiving combination therapy. A significantly higher percentage of nondiabetic patients than diabetic patients experienced optimum control (P < 0.05).Conclusions: Amlodipine appears to be a well-tolerated and effective antihypertensive drug for use in monotherapy or a combination regimen in patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite pharmacologic treatment. Because the maximum dose (10 mg once daily) was not required in most patients and because combination therapy was often not needed, amlodipine may be a low-cost option for the treatment of hypertension.

AB  - Background: The prescription of fixed-dose combinations (FDC) of antihypertensive drugs has increased rapidly since the relaxation of the prescription-term restriction. In this study, we used the opportunity of this policy change in Japan as an instrument to assess the causal impact of switching to FDC on hypertensive treatment costs.Methods: Claims data from 64 community pharmacies located in Tokyo were used to identify hypertensive patients under continuous treatment with angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). Patients switching to FDC between December 2010 and April 2011 were compared to patients who did not receive FDC (control group). Changes in annual antihypertensive drug costs were compared using a difference-in-differences approach to adjust for patient characteristics and use of concomitant medication. Subpopulation analyses were also performed, taking into account pre-index treatment patterns and prescribers' characteristics.Results: There were 542 patients who switched to FDC and 9664 patients in the control group. No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups, except for antihypertensive drug use patterns before the policy change and prescribers' characteristics. The switch to FDC was associated with an annual saving of 10,420 yen (US$112.0) in antihypertensive drug costs. Approximately 20% of the FDC patients, however, switched from ARB alone, and their drug costs increased by 2376 yen (US$25.5).Conclusions: For hypertensive patients who required ARB-based combination therapy, switching to FDC drugs had a significant cost-saving effect. However, the policy change of relaxing the prescription-term restriction could encourage aggressive treatment, i.e., switching to a combination therapy from monotherapy, regardless of medical conditions. Further research is required to evaluate the possible negative aspects of FDC drugs.

AB  - Context: Poor medication adherence diminishes the health benefits of pharmacotherapies. Elderly patients with coronary risk factors frequently require treatment with multiple medications, placing them at increased risk for nonadherence.Objective: To test the efficacy of a comprehensive pharmacy care program to improve medication adherence and its associated effects on blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).Design, Setting, and Patients: A multiphase, prospective study with an observational phase and a randomized controlled trial conducted at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center of 200 community-based patients aged 65 years or older taking at least 4 chronic medications. The study was conducted from June 2004 to August 2006.Intervention: After a 2-month run-in phase (measurement of baseline adherence, BP, and LDL-C), patients entered a 6-month intervention phase (standardized medication education, regular follow-up by pharmacists, and medications dispensed in time-specific packs). Following the intervention phase, patients were randomized to continued pharmacy care vs usual care for an additional 6 months.Main Outcome Measures: Primary end point of the observation phase was change in the proportion of pills taken vs baseline; secondary end points were the associated changes in BP and LDL-C. Primary end point of the randomization phase was the between-group comparison of medication persistence.Results: A total of 200 elderly patients (77.1% men; mean [SD] age, 78 [8.3] years), taking a mean (SD) of 9 (3) chronic medications were enrolled. Coronary risk factors included drug-treated hypertension in 184 patients (91.5%) and drug-treated hyperlipidemia in 162 (80.6%). Mean (SD) baseline medication adherence was 61.2% (13.5%). After 6 months of intervention, medication adherence increased to 96.9% (5.2%; P<.001) and was associated with significant improvements in systolic BP (133.2 [14.9] to 129.9 [16.0] mm Hg; P = .02) and LDL-C (91.7 [26.1] to 86.8 [23.4] mg/dL; P = .001). Six months after randomization, the persistence of medication adherence decreased to 69.1% (16.4%) among those patients assigned to usual care, whereas it was sustained at 95.5% (7.7%) in pharmacy care (P<.001). This was associated with significant reductions in systolic BP in the pharmacy care group (-6.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -10.7 to -3.1 mm Hg) vs the usual care group (-1.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.9 to 3.9 mm Hg; P = .04), but no significant between-group differences in LDL-C levels or reductions.Conclusions: A pharmacy care program led to increases in medication adherence, medication persistence, and clinically meaningful reductions in BP, whereas discontinuation of the program was associated with decreased medication adherence and persistence.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00393419

AB  - Objective: To evaluate treatment of mild hypertension using combinations of diet and low-dose pharmacologic therapies.Design: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.Setting: Three university-based tertiary care centers.Patients: Patients (697) 21 to 65 years of age with diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 100 mm Hg as well as weight between 110% and 160% of ideal weight.Intervention: Patients were stratified by clinical center and race and were randomly assigned to one of three diets (usual, low-sodium and high-potassium, weight loss) and one of three agents (placebo, chlorthalidone, and atenolol).Measurements: Changes in measures of sexual problems, distress, and well-being after 6 months of therapy were analyzed.Main Results: Low-dose chlorthalidone and atenolol produced few side effects, except in men. Erection-related problems worsened in 28% (95% CI, 15% to 41%) of men receiving chlorthalidone and usual diet compared with 3% (CI, 0% to 9%) of those receiving placebo and usual diet (P = 0.009) and 11% (CI, 2% to 20%) of those receiving atenolol and usual diet (P greater than 0.05). The weight loss diet ameliorated this effect. The low-sodium diet with placebo was associated with greater fatigue (34%; CI, 23% to 45%) than was either usual diet (18%; CI, 10% to 27%; P = 0.04) or weight reduction (15%; CI, 7% to 23%; P = 0.009). The low-sodium diet with chlorthalidone increased problems with sleep (32%; CI, 22% to 42%) compared with chlorthalidone and usual diet (16%; CI, 8% to 24%; P = 0.04). The weight loss diet benefited quality of life most, reducing total physical complaints (P less than 0.001) and increasing satisfaction with health (P less than 0.001). Total physical complaints decreased in 57% to 76% of patients depending on drug and diet group, and were markedly decreased by weight loss.Conclusion: In general, low-dose antihypertensive drug therapy (with chlorthalidone or atenolol) improves rather than impairs the quality of life; however, chlorthalidone with usual diet increases sexual problems in men.

AB  - PURPOSE: Verification of whether pharmacotherapeutic follow-up improves arterial blood pressure (BP) was conducted, and whether this improvement alters the quality of life of patients with resistant hypertension in a university teaching hospital in Brazil was determined. METHODS: A prospective survey of 44 patients was carried out over a period of 20 months. Each patient was followed up for 12 months. Pharmaceutical care was assessed using the following methods: measurement of the office BP and ambulatory BP monitoring, adherence to therapy, drug-related problems, and the use of health care facilities (urgent care visits and hospital admissions). The health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients was also assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and a physical symptoms profile. RESULTS: The majority (95.5%) of patients adhered to the treatment throughout the study, and there was a significant reduction in BP (p < 0.05). Nearly all of the domains of HRQOL assessed by SF-36 remained unchanged during the follow-up except for a significant improvement in social functioning (p = 0.041). There was a significant reduction in moderate and severe physical symptoms (p = 0.005). There were also significant reductions in the number of urgent care visits (p = 0.0001) and hospital admissions (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: The pharmaceutical care provided by a pharmacist in an ambulatory care clinic in Brazil improved BP, adherence to antihypertensive medications, and the social functioning of patients with resistant hypertension.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of benefit design change (BDC) on medication adherence and persistence (including switch in therapy), drug costs, and total healthcare costs. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study was performed using administrative claims data from an integrated healthcare system between January 2001 and December 2002. METHODS: Continuously enrolled patients in 2001 and 2002 with allergic rhinitis, asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or osteoarthritis belonged to employer groups with or without a pharmacy BDC as of January 1, 2002. Prescription status (same, switch, or discontinue), adherence among patients receiving therapy, and differences in drug costs and total healthcare costs for each disease state were measured between groups. Bivariate and multivariate statistics were used to test differences in outcomes between groups. RESULTS: Compared with the group without BDC, the proportion of patients who discontinued drug therapy was significantly greater in the BDC group among those with allergic rhinitis (67% vs 54%), asthma (66% vs 50%), osteoarthritis (61% vs 36%), and hypertension (39% vs 18%) (P < .05 for all). Medication compliance was not affected by BDC. The year-to-year pharmacy costs per patient in the BDC group decreased $305 for patients with osteoarthritis (P < .001) and $95 for patients with allergic rhinitis (P = .03). There was no significant effect on overall healthcare costs in any disease state during the year following the BDC. CONCLUSION: A pharmacy BDC may result in decreased pharmacy costs, with no effect on overall healthcare costs within 1 year for patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, hypertension, or osteoarthritis.

AB  - Background: Hypertension is one of the leading risk factors for ischemic heart diseases, and high rates of hypertension prevalence have either remained the same or increased in developing countries in recent years. Unfortunately, about 20% to 50% of patients with chronic diseases have been nonadherent to their drug therapy. SMS text messaging and pharmacy student-led consultations have the potential to help patients manage their blood pressure (BP).Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of SMS text messaging and consultation to manage the BP of Chinese patients with hypertension.Methods: We conducted a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial among patients with hypertension in Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, China, and recruited 384 patients from 8 community health care centers. Patients were randomized into an intervention group to receive SMS text messages and consultations or into a control group to receive usual care for 3 months. We sent SMS text messages at 3-day intervals and collected data at baseline (including demographics, clinical outcomes, medication complexity, side effects, patient behavior, knowledge about hypertension, BP, and medication adherence) and the 3-month follow-up (including BP, medication adherence, and knowledge about hypertension).Results: We assessed 445 patients with hypertension and excluded 61 patients who were not eligible or who had not filled out their questionnaires. The mean age of the patients was 68.5 (SD 7.9) years in the intervention group and 69.4 (SD 9.7) years in the control group, and the sample was primarily female (265/384, 69.0%). Patients in the intervention group showed significant improvements in systolic BP (SBP; mean 134.5 mm Hg, SD 15.5 mm Hg vs mean 140.7 mm Hg, SD 15.2 mm Hg; P=.001), medication adherence (mean 7.4, SD 1.2 vs mean 7.0, SD 1.3; P=.04), and knowledge about hypertension (mean 6.3, SD 0.9 vs mean 5.9, SD 1.2; P=.004) compared with those in the control group. In measures of diastolic BP (DBP), the two arms showed nonsignificant improvements (mean 78.2 mm Hg, SD 9.0 mm Hg vs mean 77.2 mm Hg, SD 10.3 mm Hg; P=.06). In total, 176 patients had controlled BP at the 3-month follow-up (98 patients in the intervention group vs 78 patients in the control group), but it was nonsignificant (P=.08).Conclusions: The use of SMS text messaging and consultation to manage SBP and improve medication adherence is effective, feasible, and acceptable among Chinese patients with hypertension, although a significant difference was not observed with regard to DBP. It is important to maximize the potential of SMS text messaging and consultation by increasing the feasibility and acceptance of mobile interventions and conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis on this method.Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR1900026862; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=42717.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between blood pressure and medication adherence using electronic pillboxes (MEMS). SETTING: Five general practices in Bristol, UK. SUBJECTS: A total of 239 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of hypertension and being prescribed at least one blood pressure-lowering medication. Participants were asked to use the electronic pillbox as their drug bottle for at least one month. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 'Timing adherence' (correct inter-dose intervals) as measured through MEMS and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) office blood pressure. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) timing adherence was 88% (+/-17),>80% in 175 (73%), and less than 50% in 11 (5%) participants. Adherence was monitored for a mean of 33 (+/-6) days. Mean (+/-SD) SBP was 147.9+/-19.1 mmHg and DBP 82.3+/-10.1 mmHg. There was no evidence to suggest that timing adherence was associated with SBP or DBP (overall correlation coefficients -0.01 and -0.02 respectively). According to current guidelines, about one in four of all participants had controlled SBP (only 6% of diabetic patients). DBP was under control in 66% of the individuals. CONCLUSIONS: No relationship between adherence and blood pressure in patients with hypertension recruited from primary care was found. Average timing adherence measured by electronic monitors was high (88%) and blood pressure was controlled in a minority of patients. Our findings suggest that in terms of poor blood pressure control pharmacological non-response to or insufficient intensity of blood pressure-lowering medication might be more important than poor adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the clinical and humanistic outcomes of a community pharmacist-involved collaborative care model in diabetes management.Methods: This was a parallel arm, open-label, multi-centre randomized controlled trial conducted over 6 months. Subjects with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c ≥ 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and taking ≥ 5 medications were included. Participants were randomized into intervention (collaborative care) and control groups (physician-centric care). The intervention included medication therapy management and telephonic follow-up with visits to family physicians, nurses, and dietitians. Clinical outcomes included changes in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure (SBP), lipids, and hypoglycaemic incidences. Humanistic outcomes included self-care capabilities and quality of life. Linear mixed models were constructed. Intention-to-treat analyses, with sensitivity analyses, were conducted.Results: A total of 264 participants were randomized (intervention: 131, control: 133). Significantly greater reduction in HbA1c was observed in the intervention group (intervention: -0.32% (-3.52 mmol/mol) vs. control: -0.06% (-0.66 mmol/mol), p = 0.038). Changes in SBP, lipids, and incidences of hypoglycaemia were not significant over 6 months between both groups. Significantly greater improvements in self-management (p < 0.001) and quality of life (p = 0.003) were observed within the intervention group.Conclusion: Partnering community pharmacists in a collaborative care team improved glycaemic control, quality of life and self-care capabilities of patients with diabetes and polypharmacy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease worldwide, constituting one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aims of this study were to evaluate the level of awareness and control of hypertension comparing sex, socioeconomic and educational level, BMI and drug therapy in over 40-year-old patients. The cost-effectiveness of the main pharmacologic classes of antihypertensives, as monotherapy and combination therapy, was also assessed. METHODS: In this randomized and cross-sectional populational study, a sample of 738 hypertensive adults with ages at least 40 years were evaluated. Of these, 345 (46.7%) were men and 393 (53.3%) were women. RESULTS: A total of 72.9% of the hypertensives knew about their disease. Women in the 40-49 and 50-59 age groups and obese individuals had a higher rate of awareness of their hypertensive status. The rates of awareness were similar in different social classes and educational levels, however, blood pressure control varied. beta-Blockers were the most effective drugs to control blood pressure with no differences being observed between monotherapy and combinations. Diuretics were the most cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the participants received monotherapy. The best percentage of control with monotherapy was obtained with beta-blockers but the diuretics treatment was the most cost-effective. The levels of awareness and control were high compared with developed countries, most evident in the higher social classes and higher education levels.

AB  - Background: Adherence to medication is a critical factor in the continued health and well-being of patients with hypertension. Patients' acceptance of medical advice and information may be influenced by their subjective beliefs about their health condition; therefore, it is essential that their beliefs be taken into account when giving health advice or medical treatment.Objective: To determine whether a relationship exists between illness attribution, perceived control, and adherence to antihypertensive medications.Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional survey of hypertensive patients was conducted at the University of Michigan Medical Centers, Hypertension Clinic, Ann Arbor, MI. One hundred two patients with a goal to reduce their blood pressure were included in the study. Written and follow-up telephone survey questions assessing patients' illness attributions, perceived control, and medication adherence were administered. Associations between these variables were analyzed using correlation analyses.Results: The majority of patients (67.7%) were adherent with their hypertensive medications. Patients indicated that modifiable variables were the most common attribution believed to cause hypertension; however, there was no significant relationship to medication adherence. A significant inverse relationship was found between perceived control over hypertension and medication adherence (p < 0.01).Conclusions: The findings suggest that patients' greater perception of control over trying to reduce blood pressure may result in decreased reliance on medications and subsequent nonadherence to drug therapy. Implications of these findings on pharmacy practice are discussed.

AB  - What is known and Objective There is conclusive evidence demonstrating that formulary restrictions are associated with reduced utilization and pharmacy spending of the restricted drugs. However, prior efforts to implement restrictive formularies have been associated with inconsistent rates of therapy discontinuation and mixed impacts on adherence to therapy. Also, the impact of transferring patients from an already restrictive formulary to a more aggressive model has not been previously examined. This study evaluated the impact of implementation of a more restrictive formulary on therapy disruption, adherence rates, pharmacy costs and generic utilization among patients with common chronic conditions. Methods In 2014, CVS Health implemented Value Formulary ( VF), a restrictive benefit design with the aim of reducing spending while preserving access to and adherence to essential therapy, was used. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess changes in therapy disruption rates, pharmacy costs and generic dispensing rate ( GDR) (for continuers) and medication adherence (for initiators) following the implementation of VF. The study group was selected from members of three existing employer clients transitioned from standard formulary ( SF) to VF on January 2014. The control population was a matched group of six employers with the same preperiod formulary structure, business unit, adherence programmes and patient out-of-pocket cost as the study group. The control group retained SF in 2014. To assess therapy disruption after VF implementation, we categorized patients by their subsequent medication use into three groups: (i) therapy stopped, (ii) therapy continued and (iii) therapy switched. Medication adherence was measured as monthly proportion of days covered ( PDC). Pharmacy cost and GDR were measured per utilizer per month ( PUPM). Rates of therapy disruption in study and control groups were compared using the chi-square test. Differences in monthly PDC between matched groups were evaluated using multivariate linear regression. Impact of VF on pharmacy cost and GDR was measured through segmented regression of interrupted time series data with generalized estimating equations. Results and discussion A transition from SF to VF influenced drug coverage for approximately 13% of members (as their medications were either no longer covered, or covered restrictively under VF). Compared to patients whose plan sponsors retained SF, the patients that transitioned to VF had a modest (1·3%) but statistically significant increase in therapy discontinuation rates. This was offset by similarly modest improvements in adherence; patients who initiated therapy under VF demonstrated a 1·5% higher adherence to medications as compared to SF patients ( P < 0·001). Medication costs in the VF group were lower by $20 PUPM ( P < 0·001), and GDR was greater by 4·2% ( P < 0·001). What is new and Conclusion Transition of patients to a more restrictive drug formulary led to modest therapy discontinuation, similarly modest improvements in medication adherence and substantial prescription drug cost savings. As healthcare payors search for ways to control the rapid rise in spending for medications without compromising quality, the Value Formulary can serve as a useful tool.

AB  - Background: Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease in the United States and is costing the health care system billions of dollars annually. A health program that combines education, empowerment, and monitoring has shown to improve clinical outcomes and decrease overall health care costs.Objective: To describe the implementation and effectiveness of a self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) program in a community pharmacy.Practice Description: An independent community pharmacy located within rural Southeast Missouri. On-site community pharmacists provide medication therapy management, adherence monitoring, immunizations, and reimbursed clinical services.Practice Innovation: Patients were eligible if they were older than 18 years of age and fell into one of the following categories: self-reported a new hypertension diagnosis, self-reported a desire to SMBP, were referred by a provider, or had a medication change within the 3 months before enrollment. The program consisted of 4 patient sessions. The first session obtained an initial blood pressure and provided patient education and behavior counseling. Follow-up sessions obtained average SMBP readings and reinforced previously learned concepts.Evaluation Methods: Implementation was evaluated using time and patient satisfaction. Effectiveness was evaluated using number and type of clinical problems identified, BP measurements, and test scores.Results: A total of 20 patients enrolled and completed the study. The program took 63 minutes (SD ± 18) of staff time per patient for recruitment, sessions, reminder calls, and documentation. All patients received education and monitoring and 11 additional clinical problems were documented. Systolic BP decreased an average of 17 mm Hg (P = 0.002), and diastolic BP decreased an average of 12 mm Hg (P < 0.001). Patient confidence scores increased by 14%, and 7 more patients correctly answered the post-test knowledge question. All patients reported overall satisfaction with the program as "satisfied" or "very satisfied."Conclusion: This standardized SMBP program effectively improved hypertension control and patient confidence in managing BP.

AB  - Introduction: Appropriate management of chronic diseases, including proper use of medications, can lead to better disease control, decrease disease-related complications, and improve overall health. Pharmacists have been shown to positively affect chronic disease outcomes through medication therapy management (MTM). The primary objectives of this project are to increase the number of patients with (1) A1c in control and (2) blood pressure in control; secondary objectives are to (3) describe number and type of medication-related problems identified and resolved by pharmacists providing MTM in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), (4) identify potential (pADEs) and actual adverse drug events (ADEs), and refer patients to diabetes self-management education classes, as needed. Methods: This multisite, prospective, descriptive pilot study engaged three FQHC sites with distinct models of established pharmacist MTM services to care for patients with uncontrolled diabetes and/or hypertension. Data were reported in aggregate regarding primary and secondary outcomes. Results: As of December 2015, 706 patients were enrolled in the project. Of the 422 with uncontrolled diabetes, 52.84% (n = 223) had an A1c <9%; 72 patients (17.06%) achieved an A1c between 8% and 9%, 19.19% (n = 81) of patients achieved an A1c <8% and ≥7%, and 16.59% (n = 70) of patients achieved an A1c <7%. The percentage of patients with blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg improved to 65.21%. Conclusion: Pharmacist-provided MTM can improve chronic disease intermediate outcomes for medically underserved patients in FQHCs.

AB  - : The prevalence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and the metabolic syndrome continues to increase in Latin America, while the rates of diagnosis, treatment and control of these disorders remain low. The frequency of the risk factors that constitute the metabolic syndrome and are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease has not diminished since the publication of the previous consensus. This document discusses the socioeconomic, demographic, environmental and cultural characteristics of most associated Latin American countries and partially explains the lack of better results in improving clinical and public health actions that allow high morbidity and mortality rates caused by cardiovascular diseases and DM2 to be reduced through programs aligned with the so-called precision medicine, which should be predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory. The Consensus ratifies the diagnostic criteria expressed in the previous consensus to define hypertension and DM2 but, for the metabolic syndrome, and in the absence of evidence, the recommendation is to implement a cohort study that determines the abdominal perimeter value associated with hard outcomes, such as DM2 and CVD. Meanwhile, we recommend modifying the criterion to more than 94 cm in men and more than 84 cm in women according to WHO recommendations. We also recommend the carrying out of a study that identifies the situation of hypertension and DM2 in people of African ancestry who, in Latin America, exceed 75 million and whose epidemiology does not include solid studies. With respect to the proposed therapeutic targets, we recommended maintaining those defined in the previous consensus, but insisting that early pharmacological management of prediabetes with metformin should be introduced, as should the treatment of diabetic hypertensive patients with a combination therapy of two fixed-dose antihypertensive drugs and management with statins. To increase adherence, the use of different drugs combined in a single pill (polypill) is recommended. The simplification of the therapeutic regimen is accompanied by greater control of cardiovascular risk factors, both in primary and secondary prevention, and has been shown to be cost-effective. The consensus recommends the use of the currently available polypill combining an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a statin and aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention and in patients with a high cardiovascular risk, such as hypertension patients with DM2.

AB  - The authors investigated the efficacy of a lifestyle educational program, organized in small group meetings, in improving the outcome of a nonpharmacologic intervention. One hundred and eighty-eight hypertensive patients with stable blood pressure (BP) levels and drug therapy in the previous 6 months were randomly divided into educational care (EC) and usual care (UC) groups. They were followed at 3-month intervals up to 2 years. In addition to the visits in an outpatient clinic, patients in the EC program participated in small group meetings in order to improve their knowledge of the disease and reinforce their motivation for treatment. At baseline, EC and UC groups were similar for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) levels, and pharmacologic treatment. Patients in the EC group had significantly reduced total energy, total and saturated fats, and sodium intake. Physical activity was significantly increased in the EC group as well. At the end of the 1-year follow-up, BMI (P<.001), visceral fat (P<.001), and BP (P<.001) were significantly lower in the EC group compared with the UC group. Pharmacologic treatment during the study was similar for all classes of drugs apart from diuretics whose dose was higher in the UC group at the end of the study.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Individuals treated with second-generation antipsychotic agents, including olanzapine, clozapine, quetiapine and risperidone, for the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic symptoms, are at higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Empirical evidence established atypical antipsychotic-induced metabolic disturbances as a disturbing trend in clinical settings leading to various medical complications and premature death with a prevalence at least five times higher in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia compared to healthy subjects. Despite recommendations by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), pharmaceutical agencies, and experts in the study of obesity and diabetes, the monitoring of metabolic events is not standardized practice among providers. A provider-focused intervention developed to promote a guideline-based metabolic monitoring protocol was implemented in an outpatient psychiatric clinic. The principal investigator expects improvement in psychiatric providers' knowledge of metabolic syndrome criteria, attitude towards metabolic monitoring and frequency of metabolic monitoring, following the educational intervention. The specific aims of this project are to promote best practice, reduce poor health outcomes, and decrease healthcare costs in the delivery of care for patients chronically medicated with atypical antipsychotic agents. Theoretical Framework: A pre and post-test quality improvement design using The Iowa Model of Evidence-Based Practice to Promote Quality Care framework guided the implementation a provider-focused educational intervention on metabolic syndrome monitoring. Methods: A baseline assessment was obtained through providers' self-report of knowledge, attitude and monitoring practice by means of an 18-item questionnaire. The investigator concurrently conducted a baseline retrospective chart review (N=30) to evaluate monitoring practices- collected data included subjects' family/patient history, blood pressure, weight, waist circumference, fasting lipid panel and fasting blood glucose. Secondly, an educational intervention was implemented in a single one-hour format session. Participants were educated on the recommended American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American Psychiatric Association (APA) Consensus Guidelines for Baseline Assessment and Monitoring Frequency of Persons on Atypical Antipsychotic Agents as the recommended process for screening and monitoring metabolic syndrome. Eight weeks following the provider-focused intervention, the investigator will perform a post-education 18-item questionnaire and a retrospective chart review. Data collected as part of the pre-intervention baseline survey and chart review will be compared to the post-survey and post- retrospective chart review data to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention on attitude, knowledge and monitoring trends of providers. Results: Outcomes for this project are unavailable since the project is currently in the implementation phase. Dissemination of results will be available post data analysis in December 2015. Trends and evidence of practice change will be measured and reported based on the results of the repeated measures and analysis of variance. Conclusions/Implications: Metabolic screening and monitoring practices lead to enhanced health management practices and includes improved medication therapy management, increased health and wellness education and increased medical referrals. This scholarly project emphasizes the relevance of following guidelines for the care of antipsychotic-treated individuals. It further challenges psychiatric providers to reconsider their current practice and follow the metabolic syndrome monitoring protocol as the most current best practice clinical guideline. Finally this scholarly work further validates the need for translation of evidence-based research, in this area of expertise, for positive outcomes in patients seeking psychiatric treatment. Potential benefits of routine antipsychotic-induced metabolic screening and monitoring include a decrease in metabolic health complications and premature death in mental health patients.The results of this project may be useful in guiding future advanced practice nursing educational interventions to enhance provider's attitude, knowledge and monitoring behaviors of metabolic abnormalities. Future research should focus on the development and implementation of cost effective screening and monitoring strategies in clinical settings as part of routine care, to guide future educational interventions.

AB  - A substantial proportion of the individuals with mild hypertension and the majority of individuals with moderate or severe hypertension need two or more antihypertensive medications to achieve adequate blood pressure control. The rationale for combining antihypertensive medications with different pharmacologic actions is to potentiate the hypotensive effects while minimizing dose-dependent side effects. Antihypertensive drugs can be selected that reduce blood pressure and have beneficial effects in concomitant illness and neutral or positive effects on cardiovascular risk factors. Drug therapy planning should be individualized to accommodate specific patient considerations including the potential impact of drug therapy on quality of life. In this article, beneficial as well as adverse effects of antihypertensive drug combinations are reviewed to determine special advantages or concerns in the treatment of essential hypertension.

AB  - Objective: Describe a novel approach to comprehensively summarize medication adherence.Data Sources/study Setting: Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry (n approximately 220,000)Study Design: In a new prescription cohort design (27,329 subjects prescribed new medications), we used pharmacy utilization data to estimate adherence during 24 months follow-up. Proportion of time without sufficient medications (medication gaps) was estimated using a novel measure (New Prescription Medication Gaps [NPMG]) and compared with a traditional measure of adherence.Data Collection/extraction Methods: Data derived from electronic medical records and survey responses.Principal Findings: Twenty-two percent of patients did not become ongoing users (had zero or only one dispensing of the new prescription). The proportion of newly prescribed patients that never became ongoing users was eightfold greater than the proportion who maintained ongoing use, but with inadequate adherence. Four percent of those with at least two dispensings discontinued therapy during the 24 months follow-up. NPMG was significantly associated with high out-of-pocket costs, self-reported adherence, and clinical response to therapy.Conclusions: NPMG is a valid adherence measure. Findings also suggest a larger burden of inadequate adherence than previously thought. Public health efforts have traditionally focused on improving adherence in ongoing users; clearly more attention is needed to address nonpersistence in the very first stages after a new medication is prescribed.

AB  - The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical uses, adverse effects, drug interactions, dosage, cost, and therapeutic interchange of oral angiotension-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are reviewed. ACE inhibitors attenuate the formation of angiotension II and may lead to the accumulation of kinins. Although the hypotensive effects of many ACE inhibitors may persist for 24 hours, some patients require more than one dose per day to achieve adequate control. These agents accumulate in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, but it is unclear whether dosage adjustments are necessary. ACE inhibitors are effective against mild to moderate hypertension; for severe hypertension, additional anti-hypertensive agents may be necessary. Other conditions in which ACE inhibitors have shown efficacy include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic renal insufficiency, insulin sensitivity, and coronary artery disease. The most common adverse effect is a persistent nonproductive cough. Angioedema, fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, acute renal failure, and hyperkalemia may also occur. ACE inhibitors may interact with diuretics, lithium, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral hypoglycemic agents, and some other drugs. ACE inhibitor therapy should be initiated with low doses that may then be slowly adjusted upward. Many of the agents have similar costs for lower and higher dosages. The only significant differences among the ACE inhibitors are the time of onset of hypotensive effects, time to peak effect, and duration of effect. Each formulary should include, at least, captopril and one intermediate-acting and one long-acting ACE inhibitor.

AB  - Background: Nonadherence to medications by patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) leads to unfavorable clinical outcomes. Limited data exist to demonstrate the effect of incorporating patient-centered interventions using concepts of medication therapy management and motivational interview by pharmacists on pharmacoadherence in patients requiring HD. Therefore, we assessed the impact of patient-centered pharmacist care on pharmacoadherence and its outcomes in patients requiring HD.Methods: Adult patients who had received outpatient HD for at least 3 months were enrolled. The study was conducted from October 2016 to April 2017. Pharmacists interviewed the patients at month 1, 2, 4 and 6, and the intervention (comprehensive review) occurred at months 3 and 5. The primary outcome was the change in pharmacoadherence as assessed by pre-HD serum phosphate levels and the differences in the number of medications between patient' self-report and medications records at the electronic healthcare records (EHRs). The secondary outcomes included changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), glycosylated hemoglobin levels, serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and the prevalence and types of medication-related problems (MRPs).Results: Seventy-two patients were enrolled. Their median age was 59 (interquartile range: 47-67.5) years, and 53% were men. Pre- and post-intervention pharmacoadherence, as indicated by serum phosphate levels and the differences in the number of medications between patient' self-report and the medication records at the EHRs, did not significantly differ (p = 0.682 and 0.348, respectively). Mean SBP and mean LDL did not significantly change post-intervention. The median number of MRPs declined between Months 3 and 5 (p = 0.002): the prevalence of MRPs at Month 3 was 44.9% (95 confidence interval [CI]: 40.4-49.3) and decreased to 29.8% (95 CI: 25.6-34.3) at Month 5. Drug use without indication was the most frequent MRP (23.9%).Conclusions: Patient-centered pharmacist care did not result in significant changes in pharmacoadherence. However, its clinical utility as a tool to identify and mitigate MRPs in patients requiring HD is indisputable.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03576404 (retrospectively registered on July 3rd, 2018).

AB  - Context: Although clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy, little is known about how these drugs are prescribed or used in the general population.Objective: To estimate predictors of persistence with therapy for lipid-lowering drug regimens in typical populations of patients in the United States and Canada.Design: A cohort study defining all prescriptions filled for lipid-lowering drugs during 1 year, as well as patients' demographic and clinical characteristics.Setting: New Jersey's Medicaid and Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled programs and Quebec's provincial medical care program.Patients: All continuously enrolled patients older than 65 years who filled 1 or more prescriptions for lipid-lowering drugs (N = 5611 in the US programs, and N = 1676 drawn from a 10% sample in Quebec).Main Outcome Measures: Proportion of days during the study year for which patients had filled prescriptions for lipid-lowering drugs; predictors of good vs poor persistence with therapy.Results: In both populations, patients failed to fill prescriptions for lipid-lowering drugs for about 40% of the study year. Persistence rates with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors were significantly higher than those seen with cholestyramine (64.3% vs 36.6% of days with drug available, respectively). Patients with hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease had significantly higher rates of persistence with lipid-lowering regimens. In New Jersey, multivariable analysis indicated that the poorest patients (those enrolled in Medicaid) had lower rates of drug use than less indigent patients (those enrolled in Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled) after adjusting for possible confounders, despite virtually complete drug coverage in both programs. When rates of use were measured in the US population for the 5 years following the study year, only 52% of surviving patients who were initially prescribed lipid-lowering drugs were still filling prescriptions for this drug class.Conclusion: In all populations studied, patients who were prescribed lipid-lowering drug regimens remained without filled prescriptions for over a third of the study year on average. Rates of persistence varied substantially with choice of agent prescribed, comorbidity, and socioeconomic status, despite universal coverage of prescription drug costs. After 5 years, about half of the surviving original cohort in the United States had stopped using lipid-lowering therapy altogether.

AB  - The objective of this prospective, pre-post longitudinal study was to assess the impact of pharmacist-provided medication therapy management (MTM) services on employees' health and well-being by evaluating their clinical and humanistic outcomes. City of Toledo employees and/or their spouses and dependents with diabetes with or without comorbid conditions were enrolled in the pharmacist-conducted MTM program. Participants scheduled consultations with the pharmacist at predetermined intervals. Overall health outcomes, such as clinical markers, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disease knowledge, and social and process measures, were documented at these visits and assessed for improvement. Changes in patient outcomes over time were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank and Friedman test at an a priori level of 0.05. Spearman correlation was used to measure the relationship between clinical and humanistic outcomes. A total of 101 patients enrolled in the program. At the end of 1 year, patients' A1c levels decreased on average by 0.27 from their baseline values. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure also decreased on average by 6.0 and 4.2 mmHg, respectively. Patient knowledge of disease conditions and certain aspects or components of HRQoL also improved. Improvements in social and process measures also were also observed. Improved clinical outcomes and quality of life can affect employee productivity and help reduce costs for employers by reducing disease-related missed days of work. Employers seeking to save costs and impact productivity can utilize the services provided by pharmacists. ( Population Health Management 2014;17:21-27)

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Several trials demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events during long-term follow-up in high-risk and low-risk patients. Clinical treatment guidelines propose that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be considered in the routine secondary prevention in the broad group of coronary artery disease patients. This review discusses several approaches to guide angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibition therapy to more specific groups of patients that are most likely to benefit. RECENT FINDINGS: The beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition has been shown to be consistent across subgroups in stable coronary artery disease. Still, large interindividual variability in blood pressure response is well documented. It should also be realized that the absolute treatment effects are modest. The efficiency and cost-effectiveness of this prolonged prophylactic treatment would be significantly enhanced if those patients can be distinguished who benefit most. Recently, it was suggested that markers of an activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might be used to guide angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibition therapy. SUMMARY: At the start of treatment, clinical characteristics are not sufficient to distinguish between patients who will and will not benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Although pharmacogenetic research in coronary artery disease is still in a premature stage, it may be expected to provide a useful tool in optimizing and individualizing the management of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor therapy in coronary artery disease patients.

AB  - Past and current drug therapies for weight loss are discussed. More than 50% of Americans can be categorized as overweight or obese. Obesity is associated with increased mortality and with comorbidities such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and certain cancers. According to guidelines for identification, evaluation, and treatment of obesity, patients with a body mass index (BMI) of > or = 30 kg/m2 should attempt to lose weight. Patients with a BMI of > or = 25 kg/m2 plus two or more risk factors or patients with an excessive waist circumference plus two or more risk factors should also attempt to lose weight. The initial goal is a 10% weight reduction in six months achieved through lifestyle changes. If lifestyle changes alone are not effective, then drug therapy may be indicated. Pharmacotherapeutic options for obesity have decreased over the past few years. Fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, and phenylpropanolamine have been withdrawn because of severe adverse effects, leaving only sympathomimetics, sibutramine, and orlistat as anorectics with FDA-approved labeling. Phentermine has been shown to cause a 5-15% weight loss if given daily or intermittently. Compared with sibutramine and orlistat, phentermine is cheaper, and specific formulations allow once-daily administration. However, phentermine is indicated only for short-term treatment, and tolerance often develops. Common adverse effects associated with phentermine are dry mouth, insomnia, increased blood pressure, and constipation. Sibutramine increases norepinephrine and serotonin levels in the CNS and should not be taken with many antidepressants because of the risk of increased norepinephrine and serotonin levels. Its use is also contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease. Orlistat is not systemically absorbed; therefore, it does not cause the systemic adverse effects or drug interactions of phentermine and sibutramine. Orlistat has a cholesterol-lowering effect not seen with other diet medications. However, the three-times-daily administration and frequent gastrointestinal effects limit its use. Sibutramine, phentermine, and orlistat have both positive and negative properties. Choosing among the medications will depend on concurrent disease states and medications, ease of administration, and cost.

AB  - Polypharmacy is a common observation among older adults secondary to their complex medical needs requiring management with 1 or more medications. The use of numerous medications may result in medication-related problems such as inappropriate indications, therapeutic duplication, adverse effects, drug interactions, unnecessary medications, poor adherence, and a strain on health care resources. Nurse practitioners will be required to review and streamline the appropriate and safe use of medications in patients to minimize some of the highlighted concerns. This article uses a case-based approach to showcase various issues that a nurse practitioner may encounter as it relates to polypharmacy and pharmacotherapeutic considerations. Tools are also explored to assess polypharmacy in the field. • Polypharmacy is a prevalent concern among adults who may be taking a combination of medications. • This may result in various medication-related problems such as adverse effects, drug interactions, inappropriate therapy, or nonadherence. • It is important for health practitioners to be cognizant of the tools and methods to manage polypharmacy-related issues to optimize patient outcomes.

AB  - Purpose: A collaborative pharmacist-primary care provider (PharmD-PCP) team approach to medicationtherapy management (MTM), with pharmacists initiating and changing medications at separate office visits, holds promise for the cost-effective management of hypertension, but has not been evaluated in many systematic trials. The primary objective of this study was to examine blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive patients managed by a newly formed PharmD-PCP MTM team versus usual care in a university-based primary care clinic. Methods: This randomized, pragmatic clinical trial was conducted in hypertensive patients randomly selected for PharmD-PCP MTM or usual care. In the PharmD-PCP MTM group, pharmacists managed drug-therapy initiation and monitoring, medication adjustments, biometric assessments, laboratory tests, and patient education. In the usual-care group, patients continued to see their PCPs. Participants were aged >/=18 years, were diagnosed with hypertension, had a most recent BP measurement of >/=140/ >/=90 mm Hg (>/=130/ >/=80 mm Hg if codiagnosed with diabetes mellitus), were on at least 1 antihypertensive medication, and were English speaking. The primary outcome was the difference in the mean change from baseline in systolic BP at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the percentage achieving therapeutic BP goal and the mean changes from baseline in diastolic BP and lowand high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Findings: A total of 166 patients were enrolled (69 men; mean age, 67.7 years; PharmD-PCP MTM group, n = 75; usual-care group, n = 91). Mean reduction in SBP was significantly greater in the PharmD-PCP MTM group at 6 months (-7.1 [19.4] vs +1.6 [21.0] mm Hg; P = 0.008), but the difference was no longer statistically significant at 9 months (-5.2 [16.9] vs -1.7 [17.7] mm Hg; P = 0.22), based on an intent-to-treat analysis. In the intervention group, greater percentages of patients who continued to see the MTM pharmacist versus those who returned to their PCP were at goal at 6 months (81% vs 44%) and at 9 months (70% vs 52%). No significant betweengroup differences in changes in cholesterol were detected at 6 and 9 months; however, the mean baseline values were near recommended levels. The PharmD-PCP MTM group had significantly fewer PCP visits compared with the usual-care group (1.8 [1.5] vs 4.2 [1.0]; P o 0.001). Implications: A PharmD-PCP collaborative MTM service was more effective in lowering BP than was usual care at 6 months in all patients and at 9 months in patients who continued to see the pharmacist. Incorporating pharmacists into the primary care team may be a successful strategy for managing medication therapy, improving patient outcomes and possibly extending the capacity of primary care.

AB  - Objective: Assess clinical and economic outcomes of a community-based, long-term medication therapy management (MTM) program for hypertension (HTN)/dyslipidemia. Design: Quasi-experimental, longitudinal, pre-post study. Setting: 12 community and hospital pharmacy clinics in Asheville, N.C., over a 6-year period from 2000 through 2005. Participants: Patients covered by two self-insured health plans; educators at Mission Hospitals; 18 certificate-trained pharmacists. interventions: Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular (collectively abbreviated as CV) risk reduction education; regular, long-term follow-up by pharmacists (reimbursed by health plans) using scheduled consultations, monitoring, and recommendations to physicians. Main outcome measures: Clinical and economic parameters. Results: Sufficient data were available for 620 patients in the financial cohort and 565 patients in clinical cohort. Several indicators of cardiovascular health improved over the course of the study: mean systolic blood pressure, from 137.3 to 126.3 mm Hg; mean diastolic blood pressure, from 82.6 to 77.8 mm Hg; percentage of patients at blood pressure goal, from 40.2% to 67.4%; mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, from 127.2 to 108.3 mg/dL; percentage of patients at LDL cholesterol goal, from 49.9% to 74.6%; mean total cholesterol, from 211.4 to 184.3 mg/dL; and mean serum triglycerides, from 192.8 to 154.4 mg/dL. Mean high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased from 48 to 46.6 mg/dL. The CV event rate during the historical period, 77 per 1,000 person-years, declined by almost one-half (38 per 1,000 person-years) during the study period. Mean cost per CV event in the study period was $9,931, compared with $14,343 during the historical period. During the study period, CV medication use increased nearly threefold, but CV-related medical costs decreased by 46.5%. CV-related medical costs decreased from 30.6% of total health care costs to 19%. A 53% decrease in risk of a CV event and greater than 50% decrease in risk of a CV-related emergency department (ED)/hospital visit were also observed. Conclusion: Patients with HTN and/or dyslipidemia receiving education and long-term MTM services achieved significant clinical improvements that were sustained for as long as 6 years, a significant increase in the use of CV medications, and a decrease in CV events and related medical costs.

AB  - Background: The pharmacist's role shifts from dispensing to bedside care, resulting in better patient health outcomes. Pharmacists in developed countries ensure rational drug use, improve clinical outcomes, and promote health status by working as part of a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals. However, clinical pharmacist services on healthcare utilization in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Pakistan are unclear. As a result, we aim to systematically review pharmacists' clinical roles in improving Pakistani patients' therapeutic, safety, humanistic, and economic outcomes.Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library for relevant articles published from inception to 28th February 2021. All authors were involved in the screening and selection of studies. Original studies investigating the therapeutic, humanistic, safety, and economic impact of clinical pharmacists in Pakistani patients (hospitalised or outpatients) were selected. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias in studies, and discrepancies were resolved through mutual consensus. All of the included studies were descriptively synthesised, and PRISMA reporting guidelines were followed.Results: The literature search found 751 articles from which nine studies were included; seven were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and two were observational studies. Three RCTs included were having a low risk of bias (ROB), two RCTs were having an unclear ROB, while two RCTs were having a high ROB. The nature of clinical pharmacist interventions included one or more components such as disease-related education, lifestyle changes, medication adherence counselling, medication therapy management, and discussions with physicians about prescription modification if necessary. Clinical pharmacist interventions reduce medication-related errors, improve therapeutic outcomes such as blood pressure, glycemic control, lipid control, CD4 T lymphocytes, and renal functions, and improve humanistic outcomes such as patient knowledge, adherence, and health-related quality of life. However, no study reported the economic outcomes of interventions.Conclusions: The findings of the studies included in this systematic review suggest that clinical pharmacists play important roles in improving patients' health outcomes in Pakistan; however, it should be noted that the majority of the studies have a high risk of bias, and more research with appropriate study designs is needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine how often treatment for hyperlipidemia followed the use of thiazides, compared with the use of other antihypertensive drugs, in older patients. DESIGN: Retrospective follow-up of all health claims filed over a 12-month period. SETTING: New Jersey Medicaid and Medicare programs. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 9274 enrollees, aged 65 to 99, who were newly initiated on antihypertensive medications from 1981-1989. MEASUREMENTS: We measured rates of lipid-reducing agent (LRA) initiation among patients in the 2 years following antihypertensive initiation (thiazide, non-thiazide drug, or combinations of the two) compared with rates among patients not currently taking antihypertensive agents. We used Cox regression analyses to estimate relative risks (RR), accounting for switching in antihypertensive therapy and for time when drug therapy was not currently available according to pharmacy refill records. RESULTS: There were 226 patients (2.4%) in the cohort who were started on LRA during the follow-up period. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found no significant relationship between LRA initiation and overall thiazide use (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.89-2.40), or other antihypertensive use, relative to no current exposure. However, use of high-dose thiazides (> or = 50 mg) was associated significantly with LRA initiation (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.12-3.45). Factors associated with decreased incidence of LRA use included age > or = 85 (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36-0.96), black race (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91), and nursing home residency (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.11-0.35). CONCLUSION: Use of low-cost and effective thiazide diuretics in older hypertensives was not associated with more common initiation of lipid-reducing agents, except with high-dose use of thiazides currently seen as inappropriate in most cases. Age and race were important determinants of LRA use.
