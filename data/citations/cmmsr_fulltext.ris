AB  - BACKGROUND: The Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) Plan Quality and Performance Program, or Star Ratings Program, allows Medicare beneficiaries to  compare quality of care among available Medicare Advantage prescription drug  (MA-PD) plans and stand-alone prescription drug plans (PDPs). Health plans have  increased intervention efforts and applied existing care management  infrastructure as an approach to improving member medication adherence and  subsequent Part D star rating performance. Independent Care Health Plan (iCare),  an MA-PD plan; MedImpact Healthcare Systems, Inc. (MedImpact), a pharmacy  benefits manager; and US MED, a mail order pharmacy, partnered to engage and  enroll iCare's dual-eligible special needs population in an intervention designed  to improve patient medication adherence and health plan performance for 3 Part D  patient safety outcome measures: Medication Adherence for Oral Diabetes  Medications (ODM), Medication Adherence for Hypertension (HTN), and Medication  Adherence for Cholesterol (CHOL). OBJECTIVES: To (a) assess the effectiveness of  a coordinated member-directed medication adherence intervention and (b) determine  the overall impact of the intervention on adherence rates and CMS Part D star  rating adherence measures.  METHODS: Administrative pharmacy claims and health  plan eligibility data from MedImpact's databases were used to identify members  using 3 target medication classes. Adherence was estimated by the proportion of  days covered (PDC) for all members. Those members considered at high risk for  nonadherence were prioritized for care management services. Risk factors were  based on members' use of more than 1 target medication class, newly started  therapy, and suboptimal adherence (PDC  less than  80%) in the most recent  6-month period. Data files listing member adherence rates and contact information  were formatted and loaded monthly into iCare's care management system, which  triggered an alert for care coordinators to counsel members on the importance of  adherence and offer the members an option for monthly 30-day supply medication  delivery via US MED. Member adherence rates were calculated 9 months pre- and  postimplementation for all members and adjusted by length of member enrollment  based on CMS technical specifications. Regression analysis assessed pre-post  changes in rates comparing 2 intervention groups: (1) members receiving iCare  counseling only (iCare-only) and (2) members receiving counseling and medication  delivery (iCare + US MED). To evaluate the overall impact of the intervention,  iCare's adherence rates and iCare's measure-specific star ratings for the 2011  and 2012 calendar years (CMS measurement years) were compared with the national  MA-PD plan contract average and with a health plan similar in member  characteristics but without adherence intervention exposure.  RESULTS: A total of  2,700 members were initially targeted for referral to iCare care management and  US MED customer service specialist teams. Between April 2012 (implementation  date) and January 2013, 1,302 (48.2%) members enrolled in the US MED component of  the intervention. Seventy-six percent of identified members were nonadherent  (PDC  less than  80%) to 1 of the 3 target medication classes, and 32% of members  were nonadherent to more than 1 target medication class. Pre-post absolute  average adherence rates increased for the iCare-only group (ODM = 15.1,  HTN = 10.1, CHOL = 13.6) and the iCare-US MED group (ODM = 30.9, HTN = 25.5,  CHOL = 29.4).  From 2011 to 2012, iCare adherence rates increased by absolute  differences of 15.2, 9.2, and 10.1 percentage points for ODM, HTN, and CHOL  measures, respectively, compared with the average MA-PD plan contract differences  (1.1, 2.1, and 2.5) and the comparator health plan differences (-2.7, -1.4, and  -4.1). Increases in iCare's adherence rates were associated with significant  increases in iCare's 2014 adherence measure star ratings (1 star to 3 stars for  ODM and CHOL, 1 star to 2 stars for HTN), which contributed to increases in the  Drug Plan Quality Improvement measure (2 stars to 4 stars) and iCare's overall  Part D star rating (3 to 3.5 stars).  CONCLUSIONS: Members in this MA-PD plan  dual-eligible population benefited from multiple points of contact to achieve  increased adherence. Health plans can use network pharmacies, care management  staff, and their pharmacy benefits managers to collaborate and implement  interventions aimed to improve members' adherence to targeted maintenance  medications and overall health plan quality performance and star ratings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medications are an integral component of management for many chronic conditions, and suboptimal adherence limits medication effectiveness among  persons with multiple chronic conditions (MCC). Medical homes may provide a  mechanism for increasing adherence among persons with MCC, thereby enhancing  management of chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between  medical home enrollment and adherence to newly initiated medications among  Medicaid enrollees with MCC. RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study  comparing Community Care of North Carolina medical home enrollees to nonenrollees  using merged North Carolina Medicaid claims data (fiscal years 2008-2010).  SUBJECTS: Among North Carolina Medicaid-enrolled adults with MCC, we created  separate longitudinal cohorts of new users of antidepressants (N=9303),  antihypertensive agents (N=12,595), oral diabetic agents (N=6409), and statins  (N=9263). MEASURES: Outcomes were the proportion of days covered (PDC) on  treatment medication each month for 12 months and a dichotomous measure of  adherence (PDC>0.80). Our primary analysis utilized person-level fixed effects  models. Sensitivity analyses included propensity score and person-level  random-effect models. RESULTS: Compared with nonenrollees, medical home enrollees  exhibited higher PDC by 4.7, 6.0, 4.8, and 5.1 percentage points for depression,  hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, respectively (P's<0.001). The  dichotomous adherence measure showed similar increases, with absolute differences  of 4.1, 4.5, 3.5, and 4.6 percentage points, respectively (P's<0.001).  CONCLUSIONS: Among Medicaid enrollees with MCC, adherence to new medications is  greater for those enrolled in medical homes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality in the United States, representing the highest total expenditures among major diseases.  To improve CVD-associated outcomes, medication therapy management (MTM) services  have been included in essential health benefit packages offered by various health  plans. Nevertheless, the impact of such MTM services on outcomes is still  unclear, especially from the perspective of the self-insured employer.   OBJECTIVES: To (a) compare economic outcomes between patients who received and  those who did not receive MTM services from the self-insured employer's  perspective and (b) compare clinical outcomes before and after receiving MTM  services.  METHODS: This study consisted of 2 pre- and post-retrospective  designs: (1) a cohort study with comparison groups and (2) a cohort study within  group comparison. Patients were beneficiaries aged 19 years or older who were  diagnosed with CVD conditions according to ICD-9-CM codes and continuously  enrolled in a public university-sponsored insurance plan between 2008-2010.  Patients were divided into MTM and non-MTM groups. The first MTM encounter was  assigned as the index date for the MTM group. Match-paired patients who did not  receive MTM services were randomly assigned the index date based on age category,  gender, and comorbidity. Measures for pharmacy, medical, and total expenditures  were obtained from medical and pharmacy claims. Paired t-tests and independent  t-tests using data generated from 1000 bootstraps compared mean cost difference  within and between groups. The return on investment (ROI) was calculated by  dividing the average net benefit from MTM services by the average cost of MTM  services. Clinical parameters, including blood pressure (BP) and body mass index  (BMI), were retrieved from electronic medical records from a pharmacist-provided  clinic where MTM services took place. Paired-t tests were used to compare the  mean difference between baseline and endpoint values. Further, this study  examined changes in the proportion of patients who achieved an individualized  treatment goal for BP and BMI. The study also quantified the improvement in  disease stages after the index date using the McNemar's test. Statistical  analyses were performed by using SAS software version 9.2 with statistical  significance level of 0.05.   RESULTS: A total of 63 patients and 62 match-paired  patients were included in the MTM group and the non-MTM group, respectively. The  mean cost (SD) per patient in the MTM group during the 6 months post-index period  for CVD-related pharmacy, all-cause medical, and total expenditures was lower  than the 6 months pre-index period by $22.0 (19.1), $79.2 (99.6), and $75.1  (136.2), respectively. In contrast, the mean cost (SD) for the non-MTM group  increased during the 6 months post-index date by $10.7 (24.2), $246.4 (248.4),  and $289.0 (269.5) for pharmacy, medical, and total  expenditure, respectively.  When comparing the 2 groups, the MTM group had statistically significantly lower  costs per patient for pharmacy expenditures (difference of -31.9 ± 25.1, P  less  than  0.0001), medical expenditures (difference of -$325.6 ± 271.2, P  less than  0.0001), and total direct expenditures (difference of -$359.3 ± 219.2, P  less  than  0.0001). Given the net benefit of MTM services ($359.3) and the average  cost of MTM service ($134.6), the ROI was $1.67 per $1 in MTM cost. Regarding  clinical outcomes, while no statistically significant differences were observed  in clinical outcomes, MTM services demonstrated clinical benefits. At the  post-index period, the percentage of patients who had achieved their goals  increased from 55% to 70% for BP and from 13.0% to 21.7% for normal BMI compared  with the pre-index period. In terms of the extent of improvement in disease  stages, clinical improvements in the stages of hypertension (χ2 =12.77, P  less  than  0.05) as well as BMI (χ2 =6.39, P  less than  0.05) at the endpoint were  observed.  CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular-related pharmacy, all-cause medical, and  total expenditures were statistically lower among beneficiaries who received MTM  services compared with those who did not. In addition, MTM services had a  positive ROI and demonstrated clinical significances by the increasing number of  patients who achieved treatment goals and improved disease stages for  hypertension and BMI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and sustainability of a 6-month Team Education and Adherence Monitoring (TEAM) intervention for black patients with  hypertension in community chain pharmacies. DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial.  SETTING: 28 chain pharmacies (14 TEAM and 14 control) in five Wisconsin cities  from December 2006 to February 2009. PARTICIPANTS: 576 black patients with  hypertension. INTERVENTION: Trained pharmacist-technician teams implemented a  6-month intervention using scheduled visits, Brief Medication Questionnaires  (BMQs), and novel toolkits for facilitating medication adherence and pharmacist  feedback to patients and physicians. Control participants received patient  information only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Refill adherence (≥80% days covered) and  changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and blood  pressure control using blinded assessments at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: At  baseline, all patients had blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more. Of those  eligible, 79% activated the intervention (mean 4.25 visits). Compared with  control participants at 6 months, TEAM participants achieved greater improvements  in refill adherence (60% vs. 34%, P < 0.001), SBP (-12.62 vs. -5.31 mm Hg, P <  0.001), and blood pressure control (50% vs. 36%, P = 0.01). Six months after  intervention discontinuation, TEAM participants showed sustained improvements in  refill adherence ( P < 0.001) and SBP ( P = 0.004), though the difference in  blood pressure control was not significant ( P < 0.05) compared with control  participants. Analysis of intervention fidelity showed that patients who received  the full intervention during months 1 through 6 achieved significantly greater 6-  and 12-month improvements in refill adherence and blood pressure control compared  with control participants. CONCLUSION: A team-based intervention involving  community chain pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and novel toolkits led to  significant and sustained improvements in refill adherence and SBP in black  patients with hypertension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication adherence, defined as taking medications as prescribed, is a key component in controlling disease progression and managing chronic illnesses  such as diabetes, hypertension, and high blood cholesterol. These diseases  constitute 3 of the top 5 most prevalent conditions among Medicare beneficiaries,  warranting further attention to find ways to promote better medication adherence.  The scientific literature has established the clinical and financial benefits of  medication adherence and the role of dispensing channel in impacting adherence to  medications. However, a common limitation in channel-adherence studies is the  failure to control for healthy adherer effect (HAE), referring to individuals who  are likely to engage proactively in activities that improve their adherence.  Healthier individuals may choose the home-delivery channel to ensure continuity  in their medication regimens and to minimize obstacles to adherence, such as  inadequate access, inconvenience, and financial concerns. Thus, better medication  adherence in home delivery may reflect healthier patients' predisposition to  self-select for home delivery options. To accurately attribute the impact of  dispensing channel on adherence, research would need to control for bias from a  patient's predisposition to be adherent.  OBJECTIVE: To examine the association  of pharmacy dispensing channel (home delivery or retail pharmacy) with medication  adherence for Medicare Part D beneficiaries taking medications for diabetes,  hypertension, or high blood cholesterol, while controlling for low-income subsidy  status, differences in days supply, and prior adherence behavior (PAB) as a way  to partly control for HAE. METHODS: A retrospective analysis using de-identified  pharmacy claims data from a large national pharmacy benefits manager between  October 2010 and December 2012. Continuously eligible Medicare Part D  beneficiaries (Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans participants only)  aged 65 years or older who had an antidiabetic, antihypertensive, or  antihyperlipidemic prescription claim between October and December 2010, were  identified and followed for the next 2 years. Those enrolled in a home delivery  auto refill program were excluded from this analysis. Multivariate logistic  regression was used to evaluate the impact of dispensing channel on medication  adherence, controlling for differences in demographics, low-income subsidy  status, disease burden, and drug-use pattern. Patients with a proportion of days  covered of ≥ 80% were considered to be adherent. The analysis controlled for PAB  by using patients' adherence status in the year 2011.  RESULTS: The final  analytical samples consisted of 150,389 diabetic patients, 615,618 hypertension  patients, and 358,795 high blood cholesterol patients. The adjusted odds of being  adherent for beneficiaries using home delivery were 1.25 times higher  (CI = 1.20-1.30) for diabetes medications, 1.29 times higher (CI = 1.27-1.32) for  hypertension medications, and 1.26 times higher (CI = 1.23-1.29) for high blood  cholesterol medications, compared with beneficiaries using retail channels to  obtain their prescriptions. PAB was the strongest contributor to the odds of a  patient being adherent across all 3 therapy classes, ranging from odds ratio of  4.48 to 8.09.  CONCLUSIONS: After excluding patients who received any  prescriptions via home delivery auto refill programs and controlling for PAB,  differences in days supply, low-income subsidy status, demographics, and disease  burden, Medicare beneficiaries who use home delivery for antidiabetics,  antihypertensives, or antihyperlipidemics have a greater likelihood of being  adherent than patients who fill their prescriptions at retail. The results of  this study provide evidence that where medications are received may impact  adherence, even when controlling for PAB. Use of the home delivery dispensing  channel may be an effective method to improve adherence for Medicare  beneficiaries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the most important and often overlooked challenges for accountable care organizations (ACOs) is ensuring the optimal use of  pharmaceuticals, which can be accomplished by utilizing pharmacists' skillsets  and leveraging their full clinical expertise. Developing capabilities that  support, monitor, and ensure appropriate medication use, efficacy, and safety is  critical to achieving optimal patient outcomes and, ultimately, to an ACO's  success. The program described in this article highlights the best practices of  Fairview Pharmacy Services' Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program with  additional thoughts and considerations on this and similar MTM programs provided  by The Working Group on Optimizing Medication Therapy in Value-Based Healthcare.  PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Fairview Pharmacy Services utilizes 23 MTM pharmacists  (approximately 18 full-time equivalents) working in 30 locations, who conduct  pharmacotherapy workups as part of the MTM services that Fairview provides.  Pharmacists focus on patients in a comprehensive manner and assess all of their  diseases and medications. Responsibilities include (a) identification of a  patient's drug-related needs with a commitment to meet those needs; (b) an  assessment and confirmation that all of a patient's drug therapy is appropriately  indicated, effective and safe, and that the patient is compliant; (c) achievement  of therapy outcomes and ensuring documentation of those outcomes; and (d)  collaboration with all members of a patient's care team. OBSERVATIONS: Since  1998, pharmacists have cared for more than 20,000 patients and resolved more than  107,000 medication-related problems which, if left unresolved, could have led to  hospital readmissions and emergency visits. Since becoming a Pioneer ACO,  Fairview pharmacists have focused on the highest-risk members and have seen over  670 ACO patients, resolving over 2,780 medication-related problems. In terms of  clinical outcomes, MTM contributed to optimal care in complex patients with  diabetes. A review of 2007 data found that the percentage of diabetes patients  optimally managed (as measured by a composite of hemoglobin A1c, low-density  lipoprotein, blood pressure, aspirin use, and no smoking) was significantly  higher for MTM patients (21% vs. 45%, P < 0.01). The Fairview MTM also showed a  12:1 return on investment (ROI) when comparing the overall health care costs of  patients receiving MTM services with patients who did not receive those services.  IMPLICATIONS: Developing an MTM program to manage and optimize pharmaceuticals  will be a cornerstone to managing the health of a population. Important lessons  have been learned that may be helpful to other health systems developing MTM  programs. In an accountable care environment measuring the return on the  investment of all care interventions, including MTM will be essential to maintain  the program. The ACO will also have to be able to correctly identify which  patients are candidates for MTM services and provide pharmacists with enough  autonomy, including scheduling face-to-face interactions with patients and the  ability to change prescriptions if necessary, to ensure that timely and effective  care is delivered. In order for an ACO to deliver high quality patient-centered  medication services, there must be clear lines of communication between  providers, pharmacists, and the other care providers within the organization.  Finally, a strong and visionary leader is critical to ensuring the success of an  MTM program and ultimately the ACO itself. RECOMMENDATIONS: While there is a  plethora of literature touting the benefits of either in-person or  telephonic-based MTM, there is little research to date that directly compares  these 2 MTM delivery types. It is critical for research to address the direct and  indirect costs associated with starting and maintaining an MTM program.  Information such as technologies required to start a program and length of time  until a program breaks even or meets a sufficient ROI can be helpful for health  care providers in similar health systems pitching a similar type of program.  Finally, there has yet to be significant empirical research into the cost savings  of utilizing a pharmacist and MTM services associated with meeting quality and  cost benchmarks in an accountable care payment arrangement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Only half of hypertensive adults achieve blood pressure (BP) control in the United States, and it is unclear how BP control rates may be improved most  effectively and efficiently at the population level. OBJECTIVE: We sought to  compare the potential effects of system-wide isolated improvements in medication  adherence, visit frequency, and higher physician prescription rate on achieving  BP control at 52 weeks. DESIGN: We developed a Markov microsimulation model of  patient-level, physician-level, and system-level processes involved in  controlling hypertension with medications. The model is informed by data from  national surveys, cohort studies and trials, and was validated against two  multicenter clinical trials (ALLHAT and VALUE). SUBJECTS: We studied a simulated,  nationally representative cohort of patients with diagnosed but uncontrolled  hypertension with a usual source of care. INTERVENTIONS: We simulated a base case  and improvements of 10 and 50%, and an ideal scenario for three modifiable  parameters: visit frequency, treatment intensification, and medication adherence.  Ideal scenarios were defined as 100% for treatment intensification and adherence,  and return visits occurring within 4 weeks of an elevated office systolic BP.  MAIN OUTCOME: BP control at 52 weeks of follow-up was examined. RESULTS: Among  25,000 hypothetical adult patients with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP ≥  140 mmHg), only 18% achieved BP control after 52 weeks using base-case  assumptions. With 10/50%/idealized enhancements in each isolated parameter,  enhanced treatment intensification achieved the greatest BP control (19/23/71%),  compared with enhanced visit frequency (19/21/35%) and medication adherence  (19/23/26%). When all three processes were idealized, the model predicted a BP  control rate of 95% at 52 weeks. CONCLUSION: Substantial improvements in BP  control can only be achieved through major improvements in processes of care.  Healthcare systems may achieve greater success by increasing the frequency of  clinical encounters and improving physicians' prescribing behavior than by  attempting to improve patient adherence to medications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary care providers do not routinely follow guidelines for the care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Multidisciplinary efforts may  improve care for patients with chronic disease. Pharmacist based interventions  have effectively improved management of hypertension. We performed a pragmatic,  randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a pharmacist based quality  improvement program on 1) outcomes for patients with CKD and 2) adherence to CKD  guidelines in the primary care setting. METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe  CKD receiving primary care services at one of thirteen community-based Veterans  Affairs outpatient clinics were randomized to a multifactorial intervention that  included a phone-based pharmacist intervention, pharmacist-physician  collaboration, patient education, and a CKD registry (n = 1070) or usual care  (n = 1129). The primary process outcome was measurement of parathyroid hormone  (PTH) during the one year study period. The primary clinical outcome was blood  pressure (BP) control in subjects with poorly controlled hypertension at  baseline. RESULTS: Among those with poorly controlled baseline BP, there was no  difference in the last recorded BP or the percent at goal BP during the study  period (42.0% vs. 41.2% in the control arm). Subjects in the intervention arm  were more likely to have a PTH measured during the study period (46.9% vs. 16.1%  in the control arm, P <0.001) and were on more classes of antihypertensive  medications at the end of the study (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: A one-time  pharmacist based intervention proved feasible in patients with CKD. While the  intervention did not improve BP control, it did improve guideline adherence and  increased the number of antihypertensive medications prescribed to subjects with  poorly controlled BP. These findings can inform the design of quality improvement  programs and future studies which are needed to improve care of patients with  CKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01290614.

AB  - The objective of this study was to describe medication adherence and medication intensification in a physician-pharmacist collaborative management (PPCM) model  compared with usual care. This study was a prospective, cluster, randomized study  in 32 primary care offices from 15 states. The primary outcomes were medication  adherence and anti-hypertensive medication changes during the first 9 months of  the intervention. The 9-month visit was completed by 539 patients, 345 of which  received the intervention. There was no significant difference between  intervention and usual care patients in regards to medication adherence at  9 months. Intervention patients received significantly more medication changes  (4.9 vs.1.1; P = .0003) and had significantly increased use of diuretics and  aldosterone antagonists when compared with usual care (P = .01).The PPCM model  increased medication intensification; however, no significant change in  medication adherence was detected. PPCM models will need to develop non-adherence  identification and intervention methods to further improve the potency of the  care team.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes (glycosylated hemoglobin [A1C], blood pressure, and lipids) and other measurements (disease state knowledge, adherence,  and self-efficacy) associated with the use of approved telemonitoring devices to  expand and improve chronic disease management of patients with diabetes, with or  without hypertension. SETTING: Four community health centers (CHCs) in Utah.  PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Federally qualified safety net clinics that provide medical  care to underserved patients. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Pharmacist-led diabetes  management using telemonitoring was compared with a group of patients receiving  usual care (without telemonitoring). INTERVENTIONS: Daily blood glucose (BG) and  blood pressure (BP) values were reviewed and the pharmacist provided phone  follow-up to assess and manage out-of-range BG and BP values. EVALUATION: Changes  in A1C, BP, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) at approximately 6 months were  compared between the telemonitoring group and the usual care group. Patient  activation, diabetes/hypertension knowledge, and medication adherence were  measured in the telemonitoring group. RESULTS: Of 150 patients, 75 received  pharmacist-provided diabetes management and education via telemonitoring, and 75  received usual medical care. Change in A1C was significantly greater in the  telemonitoring group compared with the usual care group (2.07% decrease vs. 0.66%  decrease; P <0.001). Although BP and LDL levels also declined, differences  between the two groups were not statistically significant. Patient activation  measure, diabetes/hypertension knowledge, and medication adherence with  antihypertensives (but not diabetes medications) improved in the telemonitoring  group. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-provided diabetes management via telemonitoring  resulted in a significant improvement in A1C in federally qualified CHCs in Utah  compared with usual medical care. Telemonitoring may be considered a model for  providing clinical pharmacy services to patients with diabetes.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Physician-pharmacist collaborative models have been shown to improve the care of patients with numerous chronic medical conditions. Team-based  health care using integrated clinical pharmacists provides one opportunity to  improve quality in health care systems that use population-based financing. In  November 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requested  that the relative value of pharmacists' work in team-based care needs to be  established. Thus the objective of this study was to describe the components of  pharmacists' work in the management of hypertension with a physician-pharmacist  collaborative model. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of the components of  pharmacists' work in the Collaboration Among Pharmacists and Physicians to  Improve Outcomes Now (CAPTION) study, a prospective, cluster randomized trial.  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: This analysis was intended to provide policymakers  with data and information, using the CAPTION study model, on the time and  intensity of pharmacists' work to understand pharmacists' relative value  contributions in the context of CMS financing and population management aims. The  CAPTION trial was conducted in 32 community-based medical offices in 15 U.S.  states and included 390 patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Blood  pressure was measured by trained study coordinators in each office, and patients  were included in the study if they had uncontrolled blood pressure. Included  patients were randomized to a 9-month intervention, a 24-month intervention, or  usual care. The goal of the pharmacist intervention was to improve blood pressure  control and resolve drug therapy problems impeding progress toward blood pressure  goals. This intervention included medical record review, a structured assessment  with the patient, collaboration to achieve goals of therapy, and patient  follow-up. The two intervention arms (9 and 24 mo) were identical the first 9  months, and that time frame is the focus of this workload evaluation. Pharmacists  completed study encounter forms for every patient encounter and estimated time  spent in pre-visit, face-to-face care, and post-visit activities. Among the 390  patients, there were 2811 encounters with pharmacists that involved 3.44  hours/patient for face-to-face care visits plus 1.55 hours/patient for pre-visit  and post-visit work. Intensity of work was reflected in interventions to resolve  drug therapy problems with patients (43% of encounters) and with physicians (1169  recommendations, of which physicians accepted 1153 [98.6%]), resulting in  improvement of patients' blood pressure goals achieved (from 0% at baseline to  43% at 9 months based on the primary study end point). CONCLUSION: Pharmacists  provided extensive interventions to patients with hypertension. This analysis  provides a framework for health systems, provider groups, and payers to measure  pharmacists' work in value-based financing and population management.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide a review of the outcomes and costs in patients seen by Clinical Pharmacy Specialist (CPS) Certified Diabetes Educators in ambulatory  care for diabetes management. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review.  METHODS: All patients discharged by a CPS for diabetes management between January  1, 2010, and December 31, 2013, were included. RESULTS: A total of 915 patients  were discharged from CPS services. The majority of patients had type 2 diabetes  (98.7%) and were female (63.1%), Hispanic (53.3%), and on average, were aged 56  years. The patients were seen by the CPS for approximately 5.3 face-to-face  visits, and by their provider for 1.9 face-to-face visits. The average difference  from baseline for glycated hemoglobin was -2.6%, while the average systolic and  diastolic blood pressures improved by -8 mm Hg and -3 mm Hg, respectively. The  major lipid parameters also reported improvement, averaging -23 mg/dL for total  cholesterol, -54 mg/dL for triglycerides, -15 mg/dL for low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, -23 mg/dL for non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C),  and +0.8 mg/dL for HDL-C. Overall, the average difference from baseline to final  visit for the numbers and costs of medications and diabetes supplies per patient  increased slightly. Medication adherence also improved each year in patients with  diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The CPSs directly impact patient care through improvements  in clinical outcomes. They help patients achieve disease-state goals for  diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia through a variety of clinical  interventions and by promoting medication adherence. These data demonstrate the  significant positive impact to the institution that clinical pharmacy services  have in diabetes management.

AB  - Patient-centered, multidisciplinary interventions offer one of the most promising strategies to improve blood pressure (BP) control, yet effectiveness trials in  underserved real-world settings are limited. We used a multidisciplinary strategy  to improve hypertension control in an underserved urban practice. We collected  1007 surveys to monitor medication adherence and used weighted generalized  estimating equations to examine trends in BP control. We examined 13,404 visits  from patients with hypertension between August 2010 and February 2014. Overall,  BP control rates increased from 51.0% to 67.4% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; 95%  confidence interval, 1.44-1.74) by the end of the intervention phase and were  maintained during the postintervention phase (adjusted odds ratio, 1.60; 95%  confidence interval, 1.41-1.82). Medication adherence scores increased across the  intervention (5.9-6.6; P < .001), but were not sustained at the conclusion of the  study (5.9-6.2; P = .16). A multidisciplinary team approach involving registered  nurses, pharmacists, and physicians resulted in substantial improvements in  hypertension control in a real-world underserved setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Taking medications as prescribed is imperative for their effectiveness. In populations such as Medicare, where two thirds of Medicare  beneficiaries have at least 2 or more chronic conditions requiring treatment with  medications and account for more than 90% of Medicare health care spend,  examining ways to improve medication adherence in patients with comorbidities is  warranted. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of pharmacy dispensing channel  (home delivery or retail pharmacy) with medication adherence for Medicare  patients taking medications with comorbid conditions of diabetes, hypertension,  and high blood cholesterol (3 of the top 5 most prevalent conditions), while  controlling for various confounders. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was  conducted using de-identified pharmacy claims data from a large national pharmacy  benefits manager between October 2010 and December 2012. Continuously eligible  Medicare Part D patients (Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan and  Prescription Drug Plan only) aged 65 years or older who had an antidiabetic,  antihypertensive, and antihyperlipidemic prescription claim between October and  December 2010 were identified and analyzed over a 2-year period. Multivariate  logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between dispensing  channel (DC) and medication adherence in calendar year (CY) 2012 controlling for  prior adherence behavior (adherence in CY2011), differences in demographics,  low-income subsidy status, days supply, disease burden, and drug-use pattern.  Patients with a proportion of days covered (PDC) of at least 80% for each of the  3 conditions were considered to be adherent, and patients with PDC less than 80%  for each of the 3 conditions were considered to be nonadherent. Patients were  assigned to a DC depending on where they filled at least 66.7% of their  prescriptions for each of the 3 conditions, and the rest were assigned to a mixed  channel group. RESULTS: The final analytical sample consisted of 40,632 patients.  The adjusted odds of adherence for patients using home delivery were 1.59 (95% CI  = 1.40-1.80) higher compared with patients using retail channels to obtain their  prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare Part D patients taking medications for  comorbid conditions who used home delivery had a greater likelihood (adjusted) of  adherence than patients who filled their antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and  antihyperlipidemic prescriptions using retail channels. Managed care stakeholders  looking to make informed decisions in a cost-constrained environment to assess,  implement, and promote solutions that improve health outcomes should consider the  use of home delivery of prescriptions to improve adherence for Medicare Part D  patients with comorbid conditions. DISCLOSURES: Funding for this study was  provided internally by Express Scripts Holding Company. Iyengar, LeFrancois,  Henderson, and Rabbitt are employees of Express Scripts. Study concept and design  were created by Iyengar and LeFrancois. Iyengar was responsible for acquisition  of data, statistical analysis, and interpretation of data. The manuscript was  written by Iyengar and LeFrancois and revised by all the authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied whether care management is a pragmatic solution for improving population blood pressure (BP) control and addressing BP disparities  between Blacks and Whites in routine clinical environments. DESIGN:  Quasi-experimental, observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 3,964  uncontrolled hypertensive patients receiving primary care within the last year  from one of six Baltimore clinics were identified as eligible. INTERVENTION:  Three in-person sessions over three months with registered dietitians and  pharmacists who addressed medication titration, patient adherence to healthy  behaviors and medication, and disparities-related barriers. MAIN MEASURES: We  assessed the population impact of care management using the RE-AIM framework. To  evaluate effectiveness in improving BP, we used unadjusted, adjusted, and  propensity-score matched differences-in-differences models to compare those who  completed all sessions with partial completers and non-participants. RESULTS: Of  all eligible patients, 5% participated in care management. Of 629 patients who  entered care management, 245 (39%) completed all three sessions. Those completing  all sessions on average reached BP control (mean BP 137/78) and experienced 9 mm  Hg systolic blood pressure (P<.001) and 4 mm Hg DBP (P=.004) greater improvement  than non-participants; findings did not vary in adjusted or propensity-score  matched models. Disparities in systolic and diastolic BP between Blacks and  Whites were not detectable at completion. CONCLUSIONS: It may be possible to  achieve BP control among both Black and White patients who participate in a few  sessions of care management. However, the very limited reach and patient  challenges with program completion should raise significant caution with relying  on care management alone to improve population BP control and eliminate related  disparities.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a physician-led point of care medication delivery system (POCMDS) on adherence to glucose, blood pressure, and  cholesterol-lowering medications. STUDY DESIGN: Prepost intervention  observational study. METHODS: From December 15, 2010, to December 14, 2012, we  conducted a prepost analyses of 800 Medicare Advantage members receiving care in  a network of capitated clinics in south Florida serving a predominantly minority  population. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of diabetes for at least 1  year, taking at least 1 of the 3 classes of medications, and having received care  in the clinic network for at least for 12 months before and after the POCMDS  implementation. Our primary outcome is the medication possession ratio  (proportion of days covered [PDC]) for each class of medication. RESULTS: We  found an absolute increase of 17 percentage points (95% CI, 13-20) in the PDC for  oral antidiabetic agents, 29 (95% CI, 26-32) for cholesterol medications, and 21  (95% CI, 19-23) for blood pressure medications. Most of the subjects (80%)  reported POCMDS was more convenient than using retail pharmacies. By having the  POCMDS prioritize generic medications, the increases in adherence were not  associated with increased pharmacy costs. At baseline, over half the patients  were at goal for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, and  systolic blood pressure; thus, we did not detect any additional improvements in  these intermediate clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among elderly minority  patients with diabetes, a POCMDS improved adherence to various medications  classes without increasing pharmacy costs. Thus, POCMDS may be of interest to  policy makers, particularly in our current era of healthcare reform.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness and cost savings of a real-world, continuous, pharmacist-delivered service with an employed patient population with  diabetes over a 5-year period. SETTING: The Patients, Pharmacists Partnerships  (P(3) Program) was offered as an "opt-in" benefit to employees of 6 public and  private self-insured employers in Maryland and Virginia. Care was provided in ZIP  code-matched locations and at 2 employers' worksites. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Six  hundred two enrolled patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes were studied between  July 2006 and May 2012 with an average follow-up of 2.5 years per patient. Of  these patients, 162 had health plan cost and utilization data. A network of 50  trained pharmacists provided chronic disease management to patients with diabetes  using a common process of care. Communications were provided to patients and  physicians. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Employers provided incentives for patients who  opted in, including waived medication copayments and free diabetes  self-monitoring supplies. The service was provided at no cost to the patient. A  Web-based, electronic medical record that complied with the Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act helped to standardize care. Quality assurance  was conducted to ensure the standard of care. EVALUATION: Glycosylated hemoglobin  (A1c), blood pressure, and total health care costs (before and after enrollment).  RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were shown by mean decreases in  A1c (-0.41%, P <0.001), low-density lipoprotein levels (-4.7 mg/dL, P = 0.003),  systolic blood pressure (-2.3 mm Hg, P = 0.001), and diastolic blood pressure  (-2.4 mm Hg, P <0.001). Total annual health care costs to employers declined by  $1031 per beneficiary after the cost of the program was deducted. This 66-month  real-world study confirms earlier findings. Employers netted savings through  improved clinical outcomes and reduced emergency and hospital utilization when  comparing costs 12 months before and after enrollment. CONCLUSION: The P(3)  program had positive clinical outcomes and economic outcomes. Pharmacist-provided  comprehensive medication therapy management services should be included as a  required element of insurance offered by employers and health insurance  exchanges.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In 2009 and 2010, 17 primary care sites within 1 healthcare system became patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs), but the sites trained different  personnel (pharmacists vs nurses) to improve diabetes care using self-management  support (SMS). We report the challenges and successes of our efforts to: 1)  assemble a new multipayer (Medicare, Medicaid, commercial) claims dataset linked  to a clinical registry and 2) use the new dataset to perform comparative  effectiveness research on implementation of the 2 SMS models. STUDY DESIGN:  Longitudinal cohort study. METHODS: We lost permission to use private-payer data.  Therefore, we used claims from Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare/Medicaid  dual-eligible patients merged with chronic disease registry data. We studied 2008  to 2010, which included 1 year pre- and 1 year post the 2009 implementation time  period. Outcomes were outpatient and emergency department visits,  hospitalizations, care process (use of statin), and 3 intermediate outcomes  (glycemic control, blood pressure [BP], and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol  [LDL-C]). RESULTS: In our sample of 2826 patients, quality of care improved and  utilization decreased over the 2.5 years. Both approaches improved lipid control  (LDL-C decreased by an average of 4 mg/dL for pharmacy-SMS and 5.6 mg/dL for  nurse-SMS) and diastolic BP (-1.5 mm Hg for pharmacy-SMS and -1.3 mm Hg for  nurse-SMS), whereas only the pharmacy-led approach decreased primary care visits  (by 0.8 visits). The groups differed slightly on 2 measures (glycated hemoglobin,  systolic BP) with respect to the trajectory of improvement over time, but  performance was similar by 2.5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes care improved during  PCMH implementation systemwide, supporting both nurse-led and pharmacist-led SMS  models.

AB  - Physician-pharmacist collaboration improves blood pressure, but there is little information on whether this model can reduce the gap in healthcare disparities.  This trial involved 32 medical offices in 15 states. A clinical pharmacist was  embedded within each office and made recommendations to physicians and patients  in intervention offices. The purpose of the present analysis was to evaluate  whether the pharmacist intervention could reduce healthcare disparities by  improving blood pressure in high-risk racial and socioeconomic subjects compared  with the control group. The analyses in minority subjects were prespecified  secondary analyses, but all other comparisons were secondary, post hoc analyses.  The 9-month visit was completed by 539 patients: 345 received the intervention,  and 194 were in the control group. Following the intervention, mean systolic  blood pressure was found to be 7.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 2.4, 12.3)  lower in subjects from racial minority groups who received the intervention  compared with the control group (P=0.0042). Subjects with ≤12 years of education  in the intervention group had a systolic blood pressure 8.1 mm Hg (95% confidence  interval 3.2, 13.1) lower than the control group with lower education (P=0.0001).  Similar reductions in blood pressure occurred in patients with low incomes, those  receiving Medicaid, or those without insurance. This study demonstrated that a  pharmacist intervention reduced racial and socioeconomic disparities in the  treatment of blood pressure. Although disparities in blood pressure were reduced  by the intervention, there were still nonsignificant gaps in mean systolic blood  pressure when compared with intervention subjects not at risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of pharmacist-conducted, home-based comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs) on drug therapy problems (DTPs) in  geriatric patients. DESIGN: Pre-/postintervention study. SETTING: Grocery store  chain affiliated with three independent living facilities. PARTICIPANTS:  Twenty-five older adults using pharmacy delivery services for at least three  chronic medications. INTERVENTION: A pharmacist conducted a home-based CMR for  each participant. DTPs were identified across 13 categories. Patients received a  medication action plan post-CMR. A follow-up patient phone call was completed two  weeks following the appointment. Patient profiles were reviewed for three months  postintervention for changes in DTPs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in DTPs per  patient and changes in five Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  triple-weighted Star Rating performance measures. RESULTS: The average DTPs  identified per patient were reduced from 3.4 ± 2.06 to 1.48 ± 1.68 (P < 0.05)  DTPs three months postintervention. The most common categories  identified-nonadherence and incorrect administration/ technique-were  significantly reduced (P = 0.012 and P = 0.010, respectively). One Star Rating  performance measure significantly improved: 68% of patients taking hypertension  medications were adherent at baseline and 91% were adherent three months post-CMR  (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-provided, home-based CMRs reduced the average  number of DTPs per patient. The most common categories of DTPs  identified-nonadherence and incorrect administration/technique-were reduced  postintervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of a telephone call reminder program provided by a campus-based medication therapy management call center on medication  adherence in Medicare Advantage Part D (MAPD) beneficiaries with hypertension.  METHODS: The reminder call services were offered to eligible MAPD beneficiaries,  and they included a live interactive conversation with patients to assess the use  of their medications. This study used a quasi-experimental design for comparing  the change in medication adherence between the intervention and matched control  groups. Adherence, defined by proportion of days covered (PDC), was measured  using incurred medication claims 6 months before and after the adherence program  was implemented. A difference-in-differences approach with propensity score  matching was used. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, paired samples  included 563 patients in each of the intervention and control groups. The mean  PDC (standard deviation) increased significantly during postintervention period  by 17.3% (33.6; P <0.001) and 13.8% (32.3; P <0.001) for the intervention and the  control groups, respectively; the greater difference-in-differences increase of  3.5% (36.3) in the intervention group over the control group was statistically  significant (P = 0.022). A generalized estimating equation model adjusting for  covariates further confirmed that the reminder call group had a significant  increase in pre-post PDC (P = 0.021), as compared with the control group.  CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive medication adherence increased in both reminder  call and control groups, but the increase was significantly higher in the  intervention group. A telephonic outreach program was effective in improving  antihypertensive medication adherence in MAPD beneficiaries.

AB  - Blacks are two to three times as likely as whites to die of preventable heart disease and stroke. Declines in mortality from heart disease have not eliminated  racial disparities. Control and effective treatment of hypertension, a leading  cause of cardiovascular disease, among blacks is less than in whites and remains  a challenge. One of the driving forces behind this racial/ethnic disparity is  medication nonadherence whose cause is embedded in social determinants. Eight  practical approaches to addressing medication adherence with the potential to  attenuate disparities were identified and include: (1) patient engagement  strategies, (2) consumer-directed health care, (3) patient portals, (4) smart  apps and text messages, (5) digital pillboxes, (6) pharmacist-led engagement, (7)  cardiac rehabilitation, and (8) cognitive-based behavior. However, while data  suggest that these strategies may improve medication adherence, the effect on  ameliorating racial/ethnic disparities is not certain. This review describes the  relationship between disparities and medication adherence, which likely plays a  role in persistent disparities in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the current methods of medication therapy management (MTM) delivery have demonstrably improved therapeutic, safety, economic, and humanistic  health outcomes, patient- and prescriber-level barriers persist, limiting its  reach and effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To assess telephonic- and community-based  clinical pharmacy services in improving health indicators for rural, underserved  patients. METHODS: In 2014, an established MTM provider created a novel,  collaborative pilot program with independent retail and community health center  pharmacies to provide comprehensive, telephonic MTM services to rural Arizonans.  This pilot program used a combined telephonic- and community-based pharmacist  approach in the provision of MTM services for rural, underserved Arizona  populations. Adults with diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension, seen by a  prescriber or who filled prescriptions at a contracted, rural facility in 2014,  were eligible to participate. Initial MTM telephonic consultations were  conducted, and recommendations were communicated to patients' prescribers and/or  pharmacists. Patients received a follow-up telephone call at standard intervals,  depending on risk severity. RESULTS: A total of 517 patients participated, and  237 medication-related and 1,102 health promotion interventions were completed.  Positive trends were observed in fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose, and  diastolic blood pressure. Broad variation in prescriber acceptance of pharmacist  recommendations was observed (27%-60%). CONCLUSIONS: Study results provide  initial evidence to support the efficacy of collaborative efforts in the  provision of MTM services for improving health indicators and safety measures  while potentially reducing health care disparities. While the results are  encouraging, future research is warranted in more diverse populations and  settings. DISCLOSURES: This work was supported in part by funding from the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention via a multiyear, interagency grant  from the Arizona Department of Health Services. The findings and conclusions  presented in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily  represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  nor the Arizona Department of Health Services.

AB  - Many ischemic stroke patients do not achieve goal blood pressure (BP < 140/90 mm Hg). To identify barriers to post-stroke hypertension management, we examined  healthcare utilization and BP control in the year after index ischemic stroke  admission. This retrospective cohort study included patients admitted for acute  ischemic stroke to a VA hospital in fiscal year 2011 and who were discharged with  a BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. One-year post-discharge, BP trajectories, utilization of  primary care, specialty and ancillary services were studied. Among 265 patients,  246 (92.8%) were seen by primary care (PC) during the 1-year post-discharge; a  median time to the first PC visit was 32 days (interquartile range: 53). Among  N = 245 patients with post-discharge BP data, 103 (42.0%) achieved a mean  BP < 140/90 mm Hg in the year post-discharge. Provider follow-ups were: neurology  (51.7%), cardiology (14.0%), nephrology (7.2%), endocrinology (3.8%), and  geriatrics (2.6%) and ancillary services (BP monitor [30.6%], pharmacy [20.0%],  nutrition [8.3%], and telehealth [8%]). Non-adherence to medications was  documented in 21.9% of patients and was observed more commonly among patients  with uncontrolled compared with controlled BP (28.7% vs 15.5%; P = .02). The  recurrent stroke rate did not differ among patients with uncontrolled (4.2%)  compared with controlled BP (3.8%; P = .89). Few patients achieved goal BP in the  year post-stroke. Visits to primary care were not timely. Underuse of specialty  as well as ancillary services and provider perception of medication non-adherence  were common. Future intervention studies seeking to improve post-stroke  hypertension management should address these observed gaps in care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To 1) identify barriers to medication adherence and 2) examine the relationship between the Indian Health Service (IHS) 3 prime questions and  medication adherence in patients with diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia  before and 6 months after intervention. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study  evaluated the effectiveness of an adherence program at an independent community  pharmacy. Patients who met inclusion criteria were telephoned monthly to answer  questions related to their medications. Patients served as their own controls to  show comparison between pre- and postintervention adherence rates calculated  according to proportion of days covered over the previous 6 months. Mean  medication adherences before and after intervention were assessed via paired t  test. Linear regression was used to analyze predictors of average medication  adherence. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used to measure the impact of  comorbid conditions on medication adherence. RESULTS: Fifty-six of 354 patients  met inclusion criteria, consented, and completed the study. The percentage of  patients achieving an adherence rate of 80% or more increased from 9% initially  to 59% at study completion. Each medication class showed improvement in adherence  rates: diabetes from 66.24% to 80.06% (P = 0.0153), hypertension from 72.33% to  81.34% (P = 0.0192), and hyperlipidemia from 64.45% to 74.66% (P = 0.0103).  Overall, average medication adherence increased by 11% (P < 0.0001). The top  patient-reported barrier to adherence was convenience/forgetfulness (46.43%).  CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-led counseling sessions with the use of the 3 prime  questions showed short-term improvement in adherence rates among patients  participating in a medication adherence program. Future studies should assess if  improved adherence is sustained long-term following active intervention.

AB  - The emphasis that United States employers are placing on employee wellness continues to grow; however, most attention has been paid to larger firms to gauge  return-on-investment from a larger pool of enrollees. With fewer resources  available to fund expansive wellness programs, smaller businesses need a  cost-effective mechanism to provide such benefits. As the most accessible  healthcare provider, community pharmacists are in an ideal position to support  certain wellness programs for smaller businesses. This research piloted a  community pharmacist-led, employer-sponsored wellness program for a self-insured  financial services company in Tennessee. Employees with diabetes, hypertension,  hyperlipidemia, asthma, or COPD were recruited from the partnering firm to  receive live, one-on-one counseling from a community pharmacist over a calendar  year. Each session was tailored to individual employee's needs and goals but  generally focused on medication adherence, diet, exercise, and health maintenance  strategies. Fifteen employees participated in the program, and improvements in  clinical measures were not realized over the course of a year. Some, albeit not  statistically significant, improvements were seen in self-reported medication  adherence and quality of life; however, a trend toward some weight gain was  observed. Results suggest that, similar to Medicare beneficiaries, working-age  adults with certain chronic conditions may benefit from pharmacist-led MTM  programs but deeper investigation is needed.

AB  - PURPOSE: Expansion of clinical pharmacist positions through sustainable funding is described. SUMMARY: The University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and  Pharmaceutical Sciences was awarded a 2-year program grant to establish an  integrated clinical pharmacy program for underserved residents in family health  centers in northeastern Colorado. The grant enabled the hiring of 2 bilingual,  full-time, board-certified, postgraduate year 2-trained clinical pharmacists to  initiate comprehensive clinical pharmacy services. Clinical pharmacy services for  diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia management were provided during direct  patient care visits using collaborative drug therapy management protocols to  facilitate comprehensive medication management. Initial visits lasted 1 hour, and  follow-up visits lasted 30 minutes. In addition, clinical pharmacists provided  point-of-care consultations for patients seeing other healthcare providers. All  patient encounters and consultations were documented in the electronic health  record. Success of the clinical pharmacy program was evaluated based on the  achievement of goal blood pressure values, glycosylated hemoglobin values, and  low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Pharmacists' involvement in patient  care activities led to improvements in all of these clinical outcomes. This  coincided with unique funding opportunities with regional accountable care  organizations that sought to demonstrate improved patient care in an expansion  population. As a result, 2 grant-funded clinical pharmacist positions in 2  community health clinics were converted into 4 faculty positions in 5 community  health centers funded by regional accountable care organizations. CONCLUSION:  Collaboration with accountable care organizations resulted in the successful  funding of ambulatory care clinical pharmacy services. These services resulted in  improved chronic disease control and provider satisfaction.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effectiveness and costs associated with addition of pharmacist-led group medical visits to standard care for patients with Type-2  Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is unknown. METHODS: Randomized-controlled-trial in  three US Veteran Health Administration (VHA) Hospitals, where 250 patients with  T2DM, HbA1c >7% and either hypertension, active smoking or hyperlipidemia were  randomized to either (1) addition of pharmacist-led group-medical-visits or (2)  standard care alone for 13 months. Group (4-6 patients) visits consisted of  2-hour, education and comprehensive medication management sessions once weekly  for 4 weeks, followed by quarterly visits. Change from baseline in cardiovascular  risk estimated by the UKPDS-risk-score, health-related quality-of-life (SF36v)  and institutional healthcare costs were compared between study arms. RESULTS:  After 13 months, both groups had similar and significant improvements from  baseline in UKPDS-risk-score (-0.02 ±0.09 and -0.04 ±0.09, group visit and  standard care respectively, adjusted p<0.05 for both); however, there was no  significant difference between the study arms (adjusted p = 0.45). There were no  significant differences on improvement from baseline in A1c,  systolic-blood-pressure, and LDL as well as health-related quality-of-life  measures between the study arms. Compared to 13 months prior, the increase in  per-person outpatient expenditure from baseline was significantly lower in the  group visit versus the standard care arm, both during the study intervention  period and at 13-months after study interventions. The overall VHA healthcare  costs/person were comparable between the study arms during the study period (p =  0.15); then decreased by 6% for the group visit but increased by 13% for the  standard care arm 13 months post-study (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Addition of  pharmacist-led group medical visits in T2DM achieved similar improvements from  baseline in cardiovascular risk factors than usual care, but with reduction in  the healthcare costs in the group visit arm 13 months after completion compared  to the steady rise in cost for the usual care arm.

AB  - PURPOSE: A telehealth-based chronic disease management program including clinical pharmacy specialists (CPSs) and the program's impact on primary care outcomes in  a population of veterans are described. SUMMARY: A telehealth program including  CPS services was developed to improve healthcare access and quality for veterans  in rural areas of the Pacific Northwest. Outcomes of medication management  services provided by a CPS team during both clinical video telehealth and  telephone encounters with 554 patients from October 2014 to March 2017 were  assessed. Patients were targeted for diabetes (DM), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and  hypertension (HTN) control and tobacco cessation; the respective primary outcomes  were the mean changes from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and  blood pressure values and rates of guideline-indicated statin therapy and tobacco  cessation. Patients in the DM and HTN groups had a mean absolute HbA(1c)  reduction of 1.61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-1.83%; p < 0.0001) and a  mean systolic blood pressure reduction of 26.00 mm Hg (95% CI, 22.99-28.50 mm Hg;  p < 0.001), respectively. In the HLD group, 93% of patients were discharged on a  lipid-lowering medication. Tobacco cessation was achieved in 42% of targeted  patients. CONCLUSION: CPSs providing primary care comprehensive medication  management services solely via telehealth improved disease management and access  to healthcare in a population of rural veterans. Statistically significant  improvements in DM and HTN outcomes were demonstrated along with clinically  significant improvements in the areas of lipid management and tobacco cessation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension remains poorly controlled on the population level. National rates of control, even when defined leniently by BP < 140/90 mm Hg, are  only ~50%. As growing healthcare costs coincide with tighter blood pressure (BP)  targets, innovative management programs are needed to maximize efficiency of care  delivery and optimize control. HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to develop a remote,  navigator-led hypertension innovation program that would leverage algorithmic  care pathways, home BP measurements and patient coaching to allow rapid and  complete medication titration. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of clinical  experts from subspecialties and primary care collaborated to develop an  evidence-based clinical algorithm, designed to be automated and administered by  non-licensed patient navigators. In the development stage, a prospective pilot  cohort of 130 patients was managed by nurse practitioners and pharmacists to  ensure efficacy and safety. Patients with clinic BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg were enrolled  and given a Bluetooth-enabled BP device. Home BPs were transmitted automatically  into the electronic medical record. Medication titrations were performed by phone  at biweekly intervals, based upon weekly average BP, until home BP was controlled  at <135/85 mm Hg. RESULTS: Eighty-one percent of all enrolled, and 91% of those  patients who regularly measured home BP achieved goal, in an average of 7 weeks.  Control was reached similarly across races, genders, and ages. CONCLUSIONS: A  home-based BP control program run by non-physicians can provide efficient,  effective and rapid control, suggesting an innovative paradigm for hypertension  management. This program is effective, sustainable, adaptable, and scalable to  fit current and emerging national systems of healthcare.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nearly half of Americans with diagnosed hypertension have uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) while some integrated healthcare systems, such  as Kaiser Permanente Northern California, have achieved control rates upwards  90%. METHODS AND RESULTS: We adapted Kaiser Permanente's evidence-based treatment  protocols in a racially and ethnically diverse population at 12 safety-net  clinics in the San Francisco Health Network. The intervention consisted of 4  elements: a hypertension registry, a simplified treatment intensification  protocol that included fixed-dose combination medications containing diuretics,  standardized BP measurement protocol, and BP check visits led by registered nurse  and pharmacist staff. The study population comprised patients with hypertension  who made ≥1 primary care visits within the past 24 months (n=15 917) and had a  recorded BP measurement within the past 12 months. We conducted a  postintervention time series analysis from August 2014 to August 2016 to assess  the effect of the intervention on BP control for 24 months for the pilot site and  for 15 months for 11 other San Francisco Health Network clinics combined.  Secondary outcomes were changes in use of guideline-recommended medication  prescribing. Rates of BP control increased at the pilot site (68%-74%; P<0.01)  and the 11 other San Francisco Health Network clinic sites (69%-74%; P<0.01).  Statistically significant improvements in BP control rates (P<0.01) at the 11 San  Francisco Health Network clinic sites occurred in all racial and ethnic groups  (blacks, 60%-66%; whites, 69%-75%; Latinos, 67%-72%; Asians, 78%-82%). Use of  fixed-dose combination medications increased from 10% to 13% (P<0.01), and the  percentage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prescriptions dispensed in  combination with a thiazide diuretic increased from 36% to 40% (P<0.01).  CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based system approaches to improving BP control can be  implemented in safety-net settings and could play a pivotal role in achieving  improved population BP control and reducing hypertension disparities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We developed a new model of hypertension care for non-Hispanic black men that links health promotion by barbers to medication management by American  Society of Hypertension-certified pharmacists and demonstrated efficacy in a  6-month cluster-randomized trial. The marked reduction in systolic blood pressure  (BP) seen at 6 months warranted continuing the trial through 12 months to test  sustainability, a necessary precondition for implementation research. METHODS: We  enrolled a cohort of 319 black male patrons with systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg at  baseline. Fifty-two Los Angeles County barbershops were assigned to either a  pharmacist-led intervention or an active control group. In the intervention  group, barbers promoted follow-up with pharmacists who prescribed BP medication  under a collaborative practice agreement with patrons' primary care providers. In  the control group, barbers promoted follow-up with primary care providers and  lifestyle modification. After BP assessment at 6 months, the intervention  continued with fewer in-person pharmacist visits to test whether the intervention  effect could be sustained safely for 1 year while reducing pharmacist travel  time. Final BP and safety outcomes were assessed in both groups at 12 months.  RESULTS: At baseline, mean systolic BP was 152.4 mm Hg in the intervention group  and 154.6 mm Hg in the control group. At 12 months, mean systolic BP fell by 28.6  mm Hg (to 123.8 mm Hg) in the intervention group and by 7.2 mm Hg (to 147.4  mm Hg) in the control group. The mean reduction was 20.8 mm Hg greater in the  intervention (95% CI, 13.9-27.7; P<0.0001). A BP <130/80 mm Hg was achieved by  68.0% of the intervention group versus 11.0% of the control group ( P<0.02).  These new 12-month efficacy data are statistically indistinguishable from our  previously reported 6-month data. No treatment-related serious adverse events  occurred in either group over 12 months. Cohort retention at 12 months was 90% in  both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among black male barbershop patrons with uncontrolled  hypertension, health promotion by barbers resulted in large and sustained BP  reduction over 12 months when coupled with medication management by American  Society of Hypertension-certified pharmacists. Broad-scale implementation  research is both justified and warranted. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:  https://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Unique identifier: NCT 02321618.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the potential health and budgetary impacts of implementing a pharmacist-involved team-based hypertension  management model in the United States. RESEARCH DESIGN: In 2017, we evaluated a  pharmacist-involved team-based care intervention among 3 targeted groups using a  microsimulation model designed to estimate cardiovascular event incidence and  associated health care spending in a cross-section of individuals representative  of the US population: implementing it among patients with: (1) newly diagnosed  hypertension; (2) persistently (≥1 year) uncontrolled blood pressure (BP); or (3)  treated, yet persistently uncontrolled BP-and report outcomes over 5 and 20  years. We describe the spending thresholds for each intervention strategy to  achieve budget neutrality in 5 years from a payer's perspective. RESULTS:  Offering this intervention could prevent 22.9-36.8 million person-years of  uncontrolled BP and 77,200-230,900 heart attacks and strokes in 5 years  (83.8-174.8 million and 393,200-922,900 in 20 years, respectively). Health and  economic benefits strongly favored groups 2 and 3. Assuming an intervention cost  of $525 per enrollee, the intervention generates 5-year budgetary cost-savings  only for Medicare among groups 2 and 3. To achieve budget neutrality in 5 years  across all groups, intervention costs per person need to be around $35 for  Medicaid, $180 for private insurance, and $335 for Medicare enrollees.  CONCLUSIONS: Adopting a pharmacist-involved team-based hypertension model could  substantially improve BP control and cardiovascular outcomes in the United  States. Net cost-savings among groups 2 and 3 make a compelling case for  Medicare, but favorable economics may also be possible for private insurers,  particularly if innovations could moderately lower the cost of delivering an  effective intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) reported that intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment reduced cardiovascular disease and  mortality compared to standard BP treatment in hypertension patients. The next  important question is how to implement more intensive BP treatment in real-world  clinical practice. We designed an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial to  simultaneously test the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention for  intensive BP treatment and its feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability in  underserved hypertension patients. METHODS: Implementation of Multifaceted  Patient-Centered Treatment Strategies for Intensive Blood Pressure Control  (IMPACTS) is a cluster randomized trial conducted in 36 Federally Qualified  Health Center clinics in Louisiana and Mississippi. Federally Qualified Health  Center clinics were randomized to either a multifaceted intervention for  intensive BP treatment, including protocol-based treatment using the SPRINT  intensive BP management algorithm, dissemination of SPRINT findings, BP audit and  feedback, home BP monitoring, and health coaching, or enhanced usual care.  Difference in mean systolic BP change from baseline to 18 months is the primary  clinical effectiveness outcome, and intervention fidelity, measured by treatment  intensification and medication adherence, is the primary implementation outcome.  The planned sample size of 1,260 participants (36 clinics with 35 participants  each) has 90% power to detect a 5.0-mm Hg difference in systolic BP at a .05  significance level and 80% follow-up rate. CONCLUSIONS: IMPACTS will generate  critical data on the effectiveness and implementation of a multifaceted  intervention for intensive BP treatment in real-world clinical practice and could  directly impact the BP-related disease burden in minority and low-income  populations in the United States.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Veterans Health Administration implemented a pilot program for primary care intensive management (PIM) for patients at high risk for  hospitalization. We examined the impact of the program on medication adherence  and adjustments for patients with chronic conditions. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized  quality improvement trial was conducted in 5 sites in which high-risk patients  were randomized into PIM or usual primary care; outcomes were measured in the 12  months before and after randomization. Interdisciplinary PIM teams assessed  patients for unmet needs and offered services including pharmaceutical care and  care coordination. METHODS: Outcomes included adherence, measured by proportion  of days covered, and several measures of medication adjustments for diabetes,  depression, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension medications.  Differences-in-differences methods were used to estimate changes in outcomes  between PIM and usual care groups. RESULTS: There were 1527 patients in the  medication adherence cohort and 1719 in the medication adjustments cohort. Mean  adherence was mostly similar between groups but 16% higher among PIM patients for  dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (for diabetes) after randomization  (0.12 vs -0.04; P = .02). The mean number of hyperlipidemia drugs filled was  higher among PIM patients (1.1 vs 1.0; P = .006). The mean number of discontinued  depression medications was higher and the mean number of dose changes for  hypertension medications was lower for PIM patients, although these comparisons  did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Medication adherence  improved for DPP-4 inhibitors, and more hyperlipidemia drugs were prescribed for  PIM patients. Overall impacts of PIM were modest.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication therapy management (MTM) was officially recognized by the federal government in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and  Modernization Act of 2003, which requires Medicare Part D plans that offer  prescription drug coverage to establish MTM programs (MTMPs) for eligible  beneficiaries. Even though the term "MTM" was first used in 2003, pharmacists  have provided similar services since the term "pharmaceutical care" was  introduced in 1990. Fairview Health Services, a large integrated health care  system, implemented a standardized pharmaceutical care service system in 1998,  naming it a pharmaceutical care-based MTM practice in 2006. OBJECTIVE: To present  the clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes of 10 years of delivering MTM  services to patients in a health care delivery system. METHODS: Data from MTM  services provided to 9,068 patients and documented in electronic therapeutic  records were retrospectively analyzed over the 10-year period from September 1998  to September 2008 in 1 health system with 48 primary care clinics. Patients  eligible for MTM services were aged 21 years or older and either paid for MTM out  of pocket or met their health care payer's criteria for MTM reimbursement; the  criteria varied for Medicaid, Medicare, and commercially insured enrollees. All  MTM was delivered face to face. Health data extracted from the electronic  therapeutic record by the present study's investigators included patient  demographics, medication list, medical conditions, drug therapy problems  identified and addressed, change in clinical status, and pharmacist-estimated  cost savings. The clinical status assessment was a comparison of the first and  most recent MTM visit to measure whether the patient achieved the goals of  therapy for each medical condition (e.g., the blood pressure of a patient with  diabetes and hypertension will be less than 130/80 millimeters mercury [mmHg] in  1 month; the patient with allergic rhinitis will be relieved of his complaints of  nasal congestion, runny nose, and eye itching within 5 days). Goals were set  according to evidence-based literature and patient-specific targets determined  cooperatively by pharmacists, patients, and physicians. Cost-savings calculations  represented MTM pharmacists' estimates of medical services (e.g., office visits,  laboratory services, urgent care visits, emergency room visits) and lost work  time avoided by the intervention. All short-term (3-month) estimated health care  savings that resulted from addressing drug therapy problems were analyzed. The  expenses of these avoided services were calculated using the health system's  contracted rates for services provided in the last quarter of 2008. The return on  investment (ROI) was calculated by dividing the pharmacist-estimated savings by  the cost of MTM services in 2008 (number of MTM encounters times the average cost  of an MTM visit). The humanistic impact of MTM services was assessed using the  results from the second patient satisfaction survey administered in 2008 (new  patients seen from January through December 2008) for the health system's MTM  program. RESULTS: A total of 9,068 patient records were in the documentation  system as of September 30, 2008. During the 10-year period, there were 33,706  documented encounters (mean 3.7 encounters per patient). Of 38,631 drug therapy  problems identified and addressed by MTM pharmacists, the most frequent were a  need for additional drug therapy (n = 10,870, 28.1%) and subtherapeutic dosage (n  = 10,100, 26.1%). In the clinical status assessment of the 12,851 medical  conditions in 4,849 patients who were not at goal when they enrolled in the  program, 7,068 conditions (55.0%) improved, 2,956 (23.0%) were unchanged, and  2,827 (22.0%) worsened during the course of MTM services. Pharmacist-estimated  cost savings to the health system over the 10-year period were $2,913,850 ($86  per encounter) and the total cost of MTM was $2,258,302 ($67 per encounter), for  an estimated ROI of $1.29 per $1 in MTM administrative costs. In the patient  satisfaction survey, 95.3% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that their  overall health and well-being had improved because of MTM. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist  estimates of the impact of an MTM program in a large integrated health care  system suggest that the program was associated with improved clinical outcomes  and cost savings. Patient satisfaction with the program was high. DISCLOSURES:  There was no external funding for this manuscript. The 3 authors are employees of  Fairview Pharmacy Services. Ramalho de Oliveira had primary responsibility for  the concept and design, writing, and revision of the manuscript, with the  assistance of Brummel and Miller. Ramalho de Oliveira performed the data  collection, and all 3 authors shared equally in data interpretation.

AB  - Heart disease and stroke are leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and high blood pressure is a major risk factor for both. Community  pharmacists are readily positioned to improve cardiovascular health through  services such as medication therapy management and self-management education. In  2018, the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health,  and NeuGen, a not-for-profit health insurer, piloted a pharmacist-led medication  therapy management program for people with hypertension in partnership with 8  community pharmacies. We evaluated changes in use of blood pressure  self-management tools and barriers to antihypertensive medication adherence  before and after medication therapy management services. Participant satisfaction  was also assessed for the 59 participants at the end of the program. We observed  improvements in self-reported use of self-management tools, reductions in  medication adherence barriers, and high satisfaction with pharmacist care. This  collaborative pilot resulted in sustainable reimbursement for participating  pharmacies delivering medication therapy management services to eligible NeuGen  members.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Mississippi Delta has high rates of chronic disease and is known for its poor health outcomes and health disparities. The University of  Mississippi School of Pharmacy (UMSOP) and the Mississippi State Department of  Health partnered in 2009 through the Mississippi Delta Health Collaborative to  reduce health disparities and improve clinical outcomes by expanding the UMSOP's  evidence-based medication therapy management (MTM) initiative, focused in  Mississippi's 18-county Delta region, to federally qualified health centers  (FQHCs) in 4 of those counties. METHODS: Between January 2009 and August 2018,  the MTM initiative targeted FQHC patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis  of diabetes, hypertension, and/or dyslipidemia. Pharmacists initially met  face-to-face with patients to review all medications, provide education about  chronic diseases, identify and resolve drug therapy problems, and take  appropriate actions to help improve the effectiveness of medication therapies.  Clinical parameters evaluated were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood  pressure (DBP), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,  triglycerides, and hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)). RESULTS: The analysis included 335  patients with hypertension (n = 287), dyslipidemia (n = 131), and/or diabetes (n  = 331). Significant mean reductions occurred in the following metrics: SBP (7.1  mm Hg), DBP (6.3 mm Hg), LDL cholesterol (24.9 mg/dL), triglycerides (45.5  mg/dL), total cholesterol (37.7 mg/dL), and HbA(1c) (1.6% [baseline ≥6%] and 1.9%  [baseline ≥9%]). CONCLUSION: Despite the cultural and environmental disadvantages  present in the Mississippi Delta, the integrated MTM treatment program  demonstrated significant health improvements across 3 chronic diseases:  hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. This model demonstrates that a  partnership between public health and pharmacy is a successful and innovative  approach to care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical services provided by pharmacists embedded in practices can improve patient outcomes within the primary care setting. Little is known about  whether physician organizations (POs) will retain the services of clinical  pharmacists after outside funding for a statewide implementation program is  ended. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a statewide program, Michigan Pharmacists  Transforming Care and Quality (MPTCQ), that incorporated pharmacists within 17  POs. METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted using data collected from June  2016 to September 2018 from primary care clinical pharmacist encounters in POs  participating in MPTCQ. Process outcomes included the number of participating  POs, patient encounters, and average visits per patient. Analyses at the  encounter level were stratified by 2 encounter types: disease state management  (DSM) or comprehensive medication review (CMR). Separately by encounter type,  pharmacist effect was described by the number, type, and reasons for medication  changes, as well as medication adherence and cost barriers found and addressed.  Clinical outcomes included hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure change.  Sustainability and patient satisfaction of pharmacists providing clinical  services are reported. RESULTS: Across 17 POs, 27 pharmacists participated in the  MPTCQ program. Pharmacists completed 24,523 patient encounters for DSM with 5,942  patients, with an average of 5 visits per patient with diabetes and 2 visits for  hypertension. Pharmacists made 15,153 therapeutic medication changes during  visits for diabetes and hypertension, with approximately 70% related to efficacy.  Pharmacists completed 4,203 CMR visits for 3,092 patients. During CMR visits,  1,296 therapeutic medication changes were recommended. Problems with medication  cost were identified in 13% of CMR visits. Blood pressure and A1c levels  decreased in patients managed by pharmacists. In 157 patients surveyed, 87% rated  their pharmacists' care as excellent. Sixteen POs retained their pharmacists at  the end of funding. CONCLUSIONS: A statewide provider-payer partnership  successfully integrated and retained primary care pharmacists within POs.  Pharmacists in the MPTCQ program contributed to improvements in disease control  by changing medications to improve patient clinical outcomes. DISCLOSURES:  Support for MPTCQ was provided by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM)  as part of the BCBSM Value Partnerships program. Coe was supported by the  National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes  of Health under award number KL2TR002241.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Uncontrolled hypertension is a common cause of cardiovascular disease, which is the deadliest and costliest chronic disease in the United  States. Pharmacists are an accessible community healthcare resource and are  equipped with clinical skills to improve the management of hypertension through  medication therapy management (MTM). Nevertheless, current reimbursement models  do not incentivize pharmacists to provide clinical services. We aim to  investigate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist-led comprehensive MTM clinic  compared with no clinic for 10-year primary prevention of stroke and  cardiovascular disease events in patients with hypertension. METHODS: We built a  semi-Markov model to evaluate the clinical and economic consequences of an MTM  clinic compared with no MTM clinic, from the payer perspective. The model was  populated with data from a recently published controlled observational study  investigating the effectiveness of an MTM clinic. Methodology was guided using  recommendations from the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and  Medicine, including appropriate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared with no  MTM clinic, the MTM clinic was cost-effective with an incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio of $38 798 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.  The incremental net monetary benefit was $993 294 considering a  willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY. Health-benefit benchmarks at  $100 000 per QALY and $150 000 per QALY translate to a 95% and 170% increase from  current reimbursement rates for MTM services. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows  current reimbursement rates for pharmacist-led MTM services may undervalue the  benefit realized by US payers. New reimbursement models are needed to allow  pharmacists to offer cost-effective clinical services.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although medication therapy management (MTM) has specific eligibility criteria and is mandated for specific Medicare Part D enrollees, some health  plans have expanded MTM eligibility beyond the minimum criteria to include other  Medicare Part D enrollees, Medicaid, and commercial health plan patients.  Differences exist in the mode of delivery, location of services, type of  personnel involved in managing the service, and the subsequent outcomes. The type  and intensity of MTM services delivered have evolved with time to more  streamlined and robust interventions, necessitating ongoing evaluation of the  effect on clinical and economic outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of  changes to an existing MTM program on cost of care, utilization, and medication  adherence. METHODS: UPMC Health Plan made changes to an existing MTM program by  expanding eligibility (customized by the type of health plan), intervention  types, pharmacist involvement, and patient followup contacts. After matching our  intervention cohort (identified January 2017-June 2018) with the pre-2016 MTM  historical controls (patients identified January 2014-June 2015 who would have  been eligible if we used the intervention cohort eligibility criteria), we  estimated that the effect of the program changes with a difference-in-difference  model (preintervention [2014-2016] and postintervention [2017-2019]). Outcomes of  interest included cost (total cost of care including medical, pharmacy, and  unplanned care [i.e., unscheduled health care use such as emergency department  visits] in 2017 U.S. dollars); utilization; medication adherence (proportion of  days covered); and return on investment (ROI). Target population included  continuously enrolled patients aged ≥ 21 years in the commercial, Medicare, and  Medicaid health plans. RESULTS: Total propensity score-matched members was  10,747, 55% of which were in the historic control group. The average (SD) ages  after matching the groups were similar (historical control group: 57.08 years  [14.23], intervention group: 56.79 years [14.21]) and the majority was female  (57%). Comorbidities identified most for patients included hypertension (77%),  dyslipidemia (70%), and diabetes (52%). Forty-one percent were in the commercial,  37% in the Medicaid, and 23% in the Medicare health plans. Proportion of care  activities undertaken in the intervention period compared with the control period  were significantly different: "sent letter to physician" (67% vs. 87%), "sent  letter to member" (15% vs. 0%), "pharmacist phone call to physician" (15% vs.  0.1%), and "pharmacist phone call to member" (13% vs. 7%). There were  statistically significant reductions in unplanned care across all health plans  especially in the Medicare population, in total cost of care, and increases in  medication adherence in 4 therapeutic classes: anticoagulants (OR = 1.25, P =  0.005), cardiac medications (OR = 1.20, P < 0.001), statins (OR = 1.21, P <  0.001), and antidepressants (OR = 1.15, P < 0.001). There was a positive ROI of  $18.50 per dollar spent, which equated to a cumulative net savings of $11 million  over 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: In a large health plan, expanding MTM eligibility,  intensifying patient follow-up contact and pharmacist involvement, and improving  provider awareness had favorable clinical and economic benefits. DISCLOSURES:  There was no funding for this project except employees' time. All authors are  employees of UPMC and have no conflicts of interest to report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The burden of diabetes is exceptionally high among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) peoples. The Indian Health Service (IHS) and Tribal  health programs provide education, case management, and advanced practice  pharmacy (ECP) services for AI/ANs with diabetes to improve their health  outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate patient outcomes  associated with ECP use by AI/AN adults with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN: This  observational study included the analysis of IHS data for fiscal years (FY)  2011-2013. Using propensity score models, we assessed FY2013 patient outcomes  associated with FY2012 ECP use, controlling for FY2011 baseline characteristics.  SUBJECTS: AI/AN adults with diabetes who used IHS and Tribal health services  (n=28,578). MEASURES: We compared health status and hospital utilization outcomes  for ECP users and nonusers. RESULTS: Among adults with diabetes, ECP users,  compared with nonusers, had lower odds of high systolic blood pressure [odds  ratio (OR)=0.85, P<0.001] and high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR=0.89,  P<0.01). Among adults with diabetes absent cardiovascular disease (CVD) at  baseline, 3 or more ECP visits, compared with no visits, was associated with  lower odds of CVD onset (OR=0.79, P<0.05). Among adults with diabetes and CVD,  any ECP use was associated with lower odds of end-stage renal disease onset  (OR=0.60, P<0.05). ECP users had lower odds of 1 or more hospitalizations  (OR=0.80, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Findings on positive patient outcomes associated  with ECP use by adults with diabetes may inform IHS and Tribal policies, funding,  and enhancements to ECP services to reduce disparities between AI/ANs and other  populations in diabetes-related morbidity and mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients living in rural communities often experience pronounced health disparities, have a higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, and  poorer access to care compared to urban areas. To address these unmet healthcare  service needs, an established, academic-based MTM provider created a novel,  collaborative program to provide comprehensive, telephonic services to patients  living in rural Arizona counties. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the program  effectiveness and described differences in health process and outcome measures  (e.g., clinical outcomes, gaps in care for prescribed medications,  medication-related problems) between individuals residing in different  rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) groups (urban, micropolitan, and small town) in  rural Arizona counties. METHODS: Subjects eligible for inclusion were 18 years or  older with diabetes and/or hypertension, living in rural Arizona counties. Data  were collected on: demographic characteristics, medical conditions, clinical  values, gaps in care, medication-related problems (MRPs), and health promotion  guidance. Subjects were analyzed using 3 intra-county RUCA levels (i.e., urban,  micropolitan, and small town). RESULTS: A total of 384 patients were included  from: urban (36.7%), micropolitan (19.3%) and small town (44.0%) areas. Positive  trends were observed for clinical values, gaps in care, and MRPs between initial  and follow-up consultations. Urban dwellers had significantly lower average SBP  values at follow-up than those from small towns (p < 0.05). A total of 192 MRPs  were identified; 75.0% were resolved immediately or referred to providers and  16.7% were accepted by prescribers. CONCLUSION: This academic-community  partnership highlights the benefits of innovative collaborative programs, such as  this, for individuals living in underserved, rural areas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are significant, but often preventable, contributors to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Medication and behavioral nonadherence are significant barriers to successful hypertension, hyperlidemia, and diabetes management. Our objective was to describe the theoretical framework underlying a tailored behavioral and educational pharmacist‐administered intervention for achieving CVD risk reduction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults with poorly controlled hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia were enrolled from three outpatient primary care clinics associated with the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Durham, NC). Participants were randomly assigned to receive a pharmacist‐administered, tailored, 1‐year telephone‐based intervention or usual care. The goal of the study was to reduce the risk for CVD through a theory‐driven intervention to increase medication adherence and improve health behaviors. RESULTS: Enrollment began in November 2011 and is ongoing. The target sample size is 500 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) intervention has been designed with a strong theoretical underpinning. The theoretical foundation and intervention are designed to encourage patients with multiple comorbidities and poorly controlled CVD risk factors to engage in home‐based monitoring and tailored telephone‐based interventions. Evidence suggests that clinical pharmacist‐administered telephone‐based interventions may be efficiently integrated into primary care for patients with poorly controlled CVD risk factors.

AB  - Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and death worldwide. Advances in technology have added telemedicine as a tool for managing hypertension. The effectiveness of telemedicine depends on patients' ability to adhere to schedules of home monitoring and case management. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension in the intervention arm of a randomized trial who completed 6 months of follow‐up were included in this analysis. They were asked to measure their blood pressure (BP) a minimum of 6 times per week using a telemonitor that transmitted the readings to their pharmacist case manager. Hypertensive patients in this study had high adherence to telemonitoring (73% took at least 6 BP readings per week) and phone visits (88% of expected visits were attended). In a multivariate analysis, older age, male sex, and some college education predicted better telemonitoring adherence. White non‐Hispanic race/ethnicity predicted better adherence to phone visits with pharmacist case managers. Telemonitoring adherence and phone adherence were highly correlated; participants who did not send readings on schedule were more likely to skip at least one phone visit with their pharmacist case manager. The findings from this analysis indicate that hypertensive patients in this study were able to achieve and maintain high adherence to both the telemonitoring and the phone case management visits.

AB  - Effective interventions to identify and treat uncontrolled hypertension (HTN), particularly in underrepresented populations that use the emergency department (ED) for primary care, are critically needed. Uncontrolled HTN contributes significantly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is more frequently encountered among patients presenting to the ED as compared to the primary care setting. EDs serve as the point of entry into the health care system for high‐risk patient populations, including minority and low‐income patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of uncontrolled/undiagnosed HTN in patients presenting to the ED is alarmingly high. Thus ED engagement and early risk assessment/stratification is a feasible innovation to help close health disparity gaps in HTN. A Hypertension Emergency Department Intervention Aimed at Decreasing Disparities (AHEAD2) trial, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is a three‐arm single site randomized clinical pilot trial of adults presenting to the ED with Stage 2 hypertension (blood pressure [BP]>160/100) comparing (1) an ED‐initiated Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral for Treatment (SBIRT) focused on HTN, (2) the same ED‐initiated SBIRT coupled with a Post‐Acute Care Hypertension Transition Consultation by ED Clinical Pharmacists, and (3) usual care. The primary outcome is mean BP differences between study arms. Secondary outcomes are proportion of participants with BP control (BP<140/90mmHg), and improvements in HTN knowledge and medication adherence scores between study arms. The objective of this report is to describe the development of the AHEAD2 trial, including the methods, research infrastructure, and other features of the randomized clinical trial design.

AB  - Team‐based care can improve hypertension control. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate blood pressure (BP) control 18 months following the discontinuation of a physician‐pharmacist collaborative intervention. This was a retrospective analysis of patients who had previously participated in a prospective, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial. Six community‐based family medicine offices were randomized to control or intervention groups. Research nurses measured BPs using an automated device during the prospective trial. The research nurses then abstracted data from medical records, including BPs, medications, changes in therapy, and laboratory values for 18 months following the discontinuation of the 6‐month prospective trial. The study included 228 patients in the control (n = 146) or intervention (n = 82) groups. The control group contained more patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (P < .013), were older (P = .047), and had more coexisting conditions (P < .001) than the intervention group. Systolic BP 9 months following discontinuation of the physician‐pharmacist intervention was 137.2 ± 18.2 mm Hg and 129.8 ± 13.3 mm Hg in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = .0015). BP control was maintained in 61 (41.8%) control patients and 55 (67.1%) intervention patients (P = .0003). At 18 months post‐intervention, systolic BP was 138.1 ± 20.4 mm Hg and 130.0 ± 16.0 mm Hg in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = .023). BP control was maintained in 53 (36.3%) control patients and 55 (67.1%) intervention patients at 18 months post‐intervention (P < .0001). A sensitivity analysis was conducted to address the uneven distribution of patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, and the differences between groups were still significant. BP control rates remained significantly higher following a physician‐pharmacist intervention compared with usual care for 18 months after discontinuation of the intervention. This model has the potential value as a useful long‐term strategy to benefit patients with hypertension.

INTERVENTION: Pharmacist‐patient clinic visits included obtaining a comprehensive medication review; performing targeted physical assessment; ordering laboratory tests; reviewing, modifying, and monitoring patients' medication therapy and providing detailed counseling on all therapies; facilitating self‐monitoring of blood glucose; and providing reinforcement of dietary guidelines and exercise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Effect of clinical pharmacists working with physicians in an ambulatory setting on health measures (e.g., A1C, blood pressure, cholesterol) of patients with diabetes. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. After 1 year, significant improvements occurred for A1C and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the intervention group compared with the control group (A1C, 7.7% vs. 8.4%; LDL, 93.7 vs. 105.1 mg/dL; P < 0.05). Systolic blood pressure improved for all study patients without a difference between the two groups. Diastolic blood pressure improved significantly in the intervention group compared with the control group (73.4 mm Hg vs. 77.6 mm Hg, P < 0.05). Significantly more intervention patients were screened for retinopathy, neuropathy, and microalbuminuria than control patients ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: For all indices measured, this study demonstrated that collaborative diabetes management with a clinical pharmacist can improve overall care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a program of cooperation between physician and pharmacist to reduce cardiovascular risk factors in patients with mild to moderate hypertension by promoting better blood pressure (BP) control, appropriate changes in antihypertensive medications, and beneficial changes in lifestyle. METHODS: The 132 subjects in this randomized, controlled trial were in the age range of 40‐79 years. The inclusion criteria were: systolic BP (SBP) ranging from 140‐179 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ranging from 90‐99 mm Hg and treatment‐naive (untreated for hypertension); or on a regimen of medication for hypertension. Of these 132 subjects, 124 (94%) were already receiving treatment with antihypertensive medications. Equal numbers of subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a physician‐pharmacist intervention group (n = 66) and a control group (n = 66). RESULTS: The 6‐month follow‐up rate was 97% in both groups. At 6 months, the mean decrease in SBP/DBP, as measured at home in the morning, was 2.9/3.3 mm Hg in the intervention group relative to baseline (P = 0.02 and P < 0.0001 for SBP and DBP, respectively). The mean decrease in home morning SBP in the intervention group was not significantly greater than in the control group. However, the DBP decline was significantly greater in the intervention than control groups, which showed a mean decrease of 2.8 mm Hg (confidence interval: ‐5.5 to ‐0.1; P = 0.04). The percentage of patients in whom control of home morning BP was achieved was 53% in the intervention group and 47% in the control group (P = 0.40). A higher percentage of patients in the intervention group, relative to the control group, were able to reduce the use of antihypertensive medications (31 vs. 8%, P < 0.0001), and fewer patients in this group required additional medications or increases in dosage relative to the controls (11 vs. 28%, P = 0.03). Patients of the intervention group were more likely to show reduction in body mass index and sodium intake and to stop smoking, as compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A program of cooperation between physician and pharmacist was successful in reducing cardiovascular risk factors in patients with mild to moderate hypertension by promoting better blood pressure (BP) control, appropriate changes in antihypertensive medications, and beneficial changes in lifestyle.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In patients with hypertension, medication adherence is often suboptimal, thereby increasing the risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke. In a randomized trial, we investigated the effectiveness of a multifaceted pharmacist intervention in a hospital setting to improve medication adherence in hypertensive patients. Motivational interviewing was a key element of the intervention. METHODS: Patients (n = 532) were recruited from 3 hospital outpatient clinics and randomized to usual care or a 6‐month pharmacist intervention comprising collaborative care, medication review, and tailored adherence counseling including motivational interviewing and telephone follow‐ups. The primary outcome was composite medication possession ratio (MPR) to antihypertensive and lipid‐lowering agents, at 1‐year follow‐up, assessed by analyzing pharmacy records. Secondary outcomes at 12 months included persistence to medications, blood pressure, hospital admission, and a combined clinical endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke, or acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS: At 12 months, 20.3% of the patients in the intervention group (n = 231) were nonadherent (MPR <0.80), compared with 30.2% in the control group (n = 285) (risk difference ‐9.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], ‐17.3, ‐2.4) and median MPR (interquartile range) was 0.93 (0.82‐0.99) and 0.91 (0.76‐0.98), respectively, P = .02. The combined clinical endpoint was reached by 1.3% in the intervention group and 3.1% in the control group (relative risk 0.41; 95% CI, 0.11‐1.50). No significant differences were found for persistence, blood pressure, or hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted pharmacist intervention in a hospital setting led to a sustained improvement in medication adherence for patients with hypertension. The intervention had no significant impact on blood pressure and secondary clinical outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients experience barriers that make it difficult to take cardiovascular disease (CVD)‐related medications as prescribed. The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) was a tailored behavioral pharmacist‐administered and telephone‐based intervention for reducing CVD risk. OBJECTIVES: To (a) describe patient‐reported barriers to taking their medication as prescribed and (b) evaluate patient‐level characteristics associated with reporting medication barriers. METHODS: We recruited patients receiving care at primary care clinics affiliated with Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Eligible patients were diagnosed with hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia that were poorly controlled (blood pressure of > 150/100 mmHg and/or low‐density lipoprotein value > 130 mg/dL). At the time of enrollment, patients completed an interview with 7 questions derived from a validated medication barriers measure. Patient characteristics and individual medication treatment barriers are described. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the association between a medication barrier score and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Most patients (n = 428) were married or living with their partners (57%) and were men (85%) who were diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia (64%). The most commonly reported barriers were having too much medication to take (31%) and forgetting whether medication was taken at a particular time (24%). In adjusted analysis, those who were not employed (1.32, 95% CI = 0.50‐2.14) or did not have someone to help with tasks, if needed (1.66, 95% CI = 0.42‐2.89), reported higher medication barrier scores. Compared with those diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, those with only hypertension (0.91, 95% CI = 0.04‐1.79) reported higher medication barrier scores. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to medication adherence are common. Evaluating and addressing barriers may increase medication adherence.

AB  - Team‐based care has been recommended for patients with treatment‐resistant hypertension (TRH), but its efficacy in this setting is unknown. We compared a physician‐pharmacist collaborative model (PPCM) to usual care in patients with TRH participating in the Collaboration Among Pharmacists and Physicians To Improve Outcomes Now study. At baseline, 169 patients (27% of Collaboration Among Pharmacists and Physicians To Improve Outcomes Now patients) had TRH: 111 received the PPCM intervention and 58 received usual care. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment arms. After 9 months, adjusted mean systolic blood pressure was reduced by 7 mm Hg more with PPCM intervention than usual care (P = .036). Blood pressure control was 34.2% with PPCM versus 25.9% with usual care (adjusted odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.33‐11.2). These findings suggest that team‐based care in the primary care setting may be effective for TRH. Additional research is needed regarding the long‐term impact of these models and to identify patients most likely to benefit from team‐based interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is poorly controlled. Team‐based care and changes in the process of care have been proposed to address these quality problems. However, assessing care processes is difficult because they are often confounded even in randomized behavioral studies by unmeasured confounders based on discretion of health care providers. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of process measures including number of counseling sessions about lifestyle modification and number of antihypertensive medications on blood pressure change and payer‐perspective treatment costs. METHODS: Data were obtained from two prospective, cluster randomized controlled clinical trials (Trial A and B) implementing physician‐pharmacist collaborative interventions compared with usual care over six months in community‐based medical offices in the Midwest. Multivariate linear regression models with both instrumental variable methods and as‐treated methods were utilized. Instruments were indicators for trial and study arms. Models of blood pressure change and costs included both process measures, demographic variables, and clinical variables. RESULTS: The analysis included 496 subjects. As‐treated methods showed no significant associations between process and outcomes. The instruments used in the study were insufficient to simultaneously identify distinct process effects. However, the post‐hoc instrumental variable models including one process measure at a time while controlling for the other process demonstrated significant associations between the processes and outcomes with estimates considerably larger than as‐treated estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Instrumental variable methods with combined randomized behavioral studies may be useful to evaluate the effects of different care processes. However, substantial distinct process variation across studies is needed to fully capitalize on this approach. Instrumental variable methods focusing on individual processes provided larger and stronger outcome relationships than those found using as‐treated methods which are subject to confounding.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a community‐based, pharmacist‐directed diabetes management program among managed care organization enrollees using National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)‐Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) performance measures. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Regional community pharmacy chain in Tulsa, OK, from November 2005 to July 2007. PATIENTS: 52 participants with diabetes and hypertension who were enrolled in a managed care organization. INTERVENTION: Diabetes management versus standard care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comprehensive diabetes care measures of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C <7.0%), blood pressure (<130/80 mm Hg), and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (<100 mg/dL). A composite research outcome of success was created by determining whether a participant achieved two of the three HEDIS goals at the end of 9 months. RESULTS: 46.7% of intervention group participants achieved the A1C goal, while 9.1% of control group participants achieved the goal ( P < 0.002). More than one‐half (53.3%) of intervention participants achieved the blood pressure goal compared with 22.7% of control participants ( P < 0.02). Among control group participants, 50% achieved the LDL cholesterol goal compared with 46.67% of intervention group participants. The odds of the intervention group attaining the composite goal were 5.87 times greater than the control group. CONCLUSION: A community pharmacy‐based diabetes management program was effective in achieving A1C and blood pressure goals measured by NCQA‐HEDIS performance standards. Program participants were statistically significantly more likely to achieve two of three HEDIS standards during a 9‐month period.

AB  - Objective: To estimate long‐term costs and outcomes attributable to a physician‐pharmacist collaborative intervention compared with physician management alone for treating essential hypertension. Methods: A Markov model cohort simulation with a 6‐month cycle length to predict acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and heart failure throughout lifetime was performed. A cohort of 399 patients was obtained from two prospective, cluster randomized controlled clinical trials implementing physician‐pharmacist collaborative interventions in community‐based medical offices in the Midwest, USA. Framingham risk equations and other algorithms were used to predict the vascular diseases. SBP reduction due to the interventions deteriorated until 5 years. Direct medical costs using a payer perspective were adjusted to 2015 dollar value, and the main outcome was quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs); both were discounted at 3%. The intervention costs were estimated from the trials, whereas the remaining parameters were from published studies. A series of sensitivity analyses including changing patient risks of vascular diseases, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and a cost‐effectiveness acceptability curve were performed. Results: The lifetime incremental costs were $26 807.83 per QALY (QALYs gained = 0.14). The intervention provided the greatest benefit for the high‐risk patients, moderate benefit for the trial patients, and the lowest benefit for the low‐risk patients. If a payer is willing to pay $50 000 per QALY gained, in 48.6% of the time the intervention would be cost‐effective. Conclusion: Team‐based care such as a physician‐pharmacist collaboration appears to be a cost‐effective strategy for treating hypertension. The intervention is most cost‐effective for high‐risk patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether screening for chronic kidney disease (CKD) can improve the care of persons at high risk for complications remains uncertain. We describe the design and early implementation experience of a pilot, cluster‐randomized pragmatic trial to evaluate the feasibility, implementation, and effectiveness of a "triple marker" CKD screening program (creatinine, cystatin C and albumin to creatinine ratio) for improving care among hypertensive veterans seen in primary care at one Veterans Administration Hospital. METHODS/DESIGN: Non‐diabetic hypertensive veterans age 18‐80 without known CKD were randomized in clusters determined by primary care provider (unit of randomization) into three arms. Usual care will be compared with two incrementally intensified treatment strategies: (1) screen for CKD followed by patient and provider education or (2) screen‐educate plus a clinical pharmacist‐led CKD and BP management program. The primary clinical outcome is systolic blood pressure (BP) change from baseline. Secondary clinical outcome is BP control. The primary process outcomes is triple marker screening (across three arms), and secondary process outcomes include use of inhibitors of the renin‐angiotensin system (ACE/ARB) overall and in persons with albuminuria, CKD recognition by PCP, use of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and NSAID education by PCP. The design uses the Veterans Health Administration electronic health record (EHR) to identify participants, deliver the interventions and ascertain study outcomes. Assessment of the program implementation will use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE‐AIM) framework. Study duration is 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 1,819 patients have been randomized within 41 provider clusters. The median age (interquartile range) is 68 years (61‐72), and 99% of participants are male. Approximately 16% are Black, and 5% Hispanic. In the first 6 months of the trial, 434 triple marker screening tests have been ordered, and 217(50%) have been tested. A total of 48 new CKD cases have been identified among those tested, for a preliminary yield of 22%. CONCLUSION: We have successfully implemented a pragmatic protocol that uses the EHR to identify and characterize eligible participants, deliver the intervention, and ascertain study outcomes with high rates of participation by providers and patients. Results from this study can guide design of pragmatic trials in the field of CKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01978951 ; Date or Registration: 1/17/2014.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Group medical clinics (GMCs) are widely used in the management of diabetes and hypertension, but data on their effectiveness are limited. OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of GMCs in the management of comorbid diabetes and hypertension. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00286741) SETTING: 2 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in North Carolina and Virginia. PATIENTS: 239 patients with poorly controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A(1c) [HbA(1c)] level > or =7.5%) and hypertension (systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg). INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned within each center to either attend a GMC or receive usual care. Clinics comprised 7 to 8 patients and a care team that consisted of a primary care general internist, a pharmacist, and a nurse or other certified diabetes educator. Each session included structured group interactions moderated by the educator. The pharmacist and physician adjusted medication to manage each patient's HbA(1c) level and blood pressure. MEASUREMENTS: Hemoglobin A(1c) level and systolic blood pressure, measured by blinded research personnel at baseline, study midpoint (median, 6.8 months), and study completion (median follow‐up, 12.8 months). Linear mixed models, adjusted for clustering within GMCs, were used to compare HbA(1c) levels and systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: Mean baseline systolic blood pressure and HbA(1c) level were 152.9 mm Hg (SD, 14.2) and 9.2% (SD, 1.4), respectively. At the end of the study, mean systolic blood pressure improved by 13.7 mm Hg in the GMC group and 6.4 mm Hg in the usual care group (P = 0.011 by linear mixed model), whereas mean HbA(1c) level improved by 0.8% in the GMC group and 0.5% in the usual care group (P = 0.159). LIMITATION: Measurements of effectiveness may have been limited by concomitant improvements in the usual care group that were due to co‐intervention. CONCLUSION: Group medical clinics are a potent strategy for improving blood pressure but not HbA(1c) level in diabetic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Even in high‐performing health systems, some patients with diabetes mellitus have poor blood pressure (BP) control because of poor medication adherence and lack of medication intensification. We examined whether the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention, a pharmacist‐led intervention combining elements found in efficacy studies to lower BP, improved BP among patients with diabetes mellitus with persistent hypertension and poor refill adherence or insufficient medication intensification in 2 high‐performing health systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective, multisite cluster randomized pragmatic trial with randomization of 16 primary care teams at 5 medical centers (3 Veterans Affairs and 2 Kaiser Permanente) to the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention or usual care. The primary outcome was relative change in systolic BP (SBP), comparing 1797 intervention with 2303 control team patients, from 6 months preceding to 6 months after the 14‐month intervention period. We examined shorter‐term changes in SBP as a secondary outcome. The mean SBP decrease from 6 months before to 6 months after the intervention period was ≈9 mm Hg in both arms. Mean SBPs of eligible intervention patients were 2.4 mm Hg lower (95% CI: ‐3.4 to ‐1.5; P<0.001) immediately after the intervention than those achieved by control patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Adherence and Intensification of Medications program more rapidly lowered SBPs among intervention patients, but usual‐care patients achieved equally low SBP levels by 6 months after the intervention period. These findings show the importance of evaluating in different real‐life clinical settings programs found in efficacy trials to be effective before urging their widespread adoption in all settings.

T2  - Clinical and experimental hypertension (New York, N.Y. : 1993)
AB  - Evening dosing of antihypertensive medications lowers nighttime blood pressure, and in one large randomized trial, it reduced the risk for cardiovascular outcomes. However, the feasibility of nighttime dosing in routine clinical practice is unknown. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of a brief pharmacist intervention to assign patients to take antihypertensive medications at specific times of the day. In this pilot, randomized controlled trial, 79 patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) taking one or more antihypertensive medications once daily were randomized to take one once‐daily antihypertensive either in the morning or in the evening. A total of 79 patients were randomized (39 to morning dosing, 40 to evening dosing). Average (SD) age was 56.5 (14) years, 68% were male, and average (SD) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 36.6 (8.9) mL/min/1.73m2. Adherence, defined as taking the once‐daily medication at the time indicated six or seven times in the last 7 days and not taking it at any other time during the day, was 91% in the morning arm and 95% in the evening arm (p = 0.57). This pilot demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of a pharmacist‐physician collaborative to assign once���daily antihypertensive medications to either morning or evening dosing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately half of patients with chronic cardiometabolic conditions are nonadherent with their prescribed medications. Interventions to improve adherence have been only modestly effective because they often address single barriers to adherence, intervene at single points in time, or are imprecisely targeted to patients who may not need adherence assistance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a multicomponent, behaviorally tailored pharmacist‐based intervention to improve adherence to medications for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. TRIAL DESIGN: The STIC2IT trial is a cluster‐randomized pragmatic trial testing the impact of a pharmacist‐led multicomponent intervention that uses behavioral interviewing, text messaging, mailed progress reports, and video visits. Targeted patients are those who are nonadherent to glucose‐lowering, antihypertensive, or statin medications and who also have evidence of poor disease control. The intervention is tailored to patients' individual health barriers and their level of health activation. We cluster‐randomized 14 practice sites of a large multispecialty group practice to receive either the pharmacist‐based intervention or usual care. STIC2IT has enrolled 4,076 patients who will be followed up for 12months after randomization. The trial's primary outcome is medication adherence, assessed using pharmacy claims data. Secondary outcomes are disease control and health care resource utilization. CONCLUSION: This trial will determine whether a technologically enabled, behaviorally targeted pharmacist‐based intervention results in improved adherence and disease control. If effective, this strategy could be a scalable method of offering tailored adherence support to those with the greatest clinical need.

AB  - Background: In the treatment of coronary heart disease, secondary prevention goals are still often unmet and poor adherence to prescribed drugs has been suggested as one of the reasons. We aimed to investigate whether pharmaceutical care by a pharmacist at the cardiology clinic trained in motivational interviewing improves clinical outcomes and patient adherence. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, outcomes‐blinded trial designed to compare pharmaceutical care follow‐up with standard care. After standard follow‐up at the cardiology clinic, patients in the intervention group were seen by a clinical pharmacist two to five times as required over seven months. Pharmacists were trained to use motivational interviewing in the consultations and they tailored their support to each patient’s clinical needs and beliefs about medicines. The primary study end‐point was the proportion of patients who reached the treatment goal for low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol by 12 months after discharge. The key secondary outcome was patient adherence to lipid‐lowering therapy at 15 months after discharge, and other secondary outcomes were the effects on patient adherence to other preventive drugs, systolic blood pressure, disease‐specific quality of life, and healthcare use. Results: 316 patients were included. The proportion of patients who reached the target for low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol were 37.0% in the intervention group and 44.2% in the control group (P =.263). More intervention than control patients were adherent to cholesterol‐lowering drugs (88 vs 77%; P =.033) and aspirin (97 vs 91%; P =.036) but not to beta‐blocking agents or renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors. Conclusions: Our intervention had no positive effects on risk factors for CHD, but it increased patient adherence. Further investigation of the intervention process is needed to explore the difference in results between patient adherence and medication effects. Longer follow‐up of healthcare use and mortality will determine if the increased adherence per se eventually will have a meaningful effect on patient health.

AB  - Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) in the United States. Multiple risk factors contribute to DKD development, yet few interventions target more than a single DKD risk factor at a time. This manuscript describes the study protocol, recruitment, and baseline participant characteristics for the Simultaneous Risk Factor Control Using Telehealth to slOw Progression of Diabetic Kidney Disease (STOP‐DKD) study. The STOP‐DKD study is a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifactorial behavioral and medication management intervention to mitigate kidney function decline at 3 years compared to usual care. The intervention consists of up to 36 monthly educational modules delivered via telephone by a study pharmacist, home blood pressure monitoring, and medication management recommendations delivered electronically to primary care physicians. Patients seen at seven primary care clinics in North Carolina, with diabetes and [1] uncontrolled hypertension and [2] evidence of kidney dysfunction (albuminuria or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) were eligible to participate. Study recruitment completed in December 2014. Of the 281 participants randomized, mean age at baseline was 61.9; 52% were male, 56% were Black, and most were high school graduates (89%). Baseline co‐morbidity was high‐ mean blood pressure was 134/76 mmHg, mean body mass index was 35.7 kg/m2, mean eGFR was 80.7 ml/min/1.73 m2, and mean glycated hemoglobin was 8.0%. Experiences of recruiting and implementing a comprehensive DKD program to individuals at high risk seen in the primary care setting are provided. Trial Registration:NCT01829256.

AB  - Background: It is important to understand which components of successful multifaceted interventions are responsible for study outcomes, since some components may be more important contributors to the intervention effect than others. Objective: We conducted a mediation analysis to determine which of seven factors had the greatest effect on change in systolic blood pressure (BP) after 6 months in a trial to improve hypertension control. Design: The study was a preplanned secondary analysis of a cluster‐randomized clinical trial. Eight clinics in an integrated health system were randomized to provide usual care to their patients (n = 222), and eight were randomized to provide a telemonitoring intervention (n = 228). Participants: Four hundred three of 450 trial participants completing the 6‐month follow‐up visit were included. Interventions: Intervention group participants received home BP telemonitors and transmitted measurements to pharmacists, who adjusted medications and provided advice to improve adherence to medications and lifestyle modification via telephone visits. Main measures: Path analytic models estimated indirect effects of the seven potential mediators of intervention effect (defined as the difference between the intervention and usual care groups in change in systolic BP from baseline to 6 months). The potential mediators were change in home BP monitor use, number of BP medication classes, adherence to BP medications, physical activity, salt intake, alcohol use, and weight. Key Results: The difference in change in systolic BP was 11.3 mmHg. The multivariable mediation model explained 47 % (5.3 mmHg) of the intervention effect. Nearly all of this was mediated by two factors: an increase in medication treatment intensity (24 %) and increased home BP monitor use (19 %). The other five factors were not significant mediators, although medication adherence and salt intake improved more in the intervention group than in the usual care group. Conclusions: Most of the explained intervention effect was attributable to the combination of self‐monitoring and medication intensification. High adherence at baseline and the relatively low intensity of resources directed toward lifestyle change may explain why these factors did not contribute to the improvement in BP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most diabetic and hypertensive patients, principally the elderly, do not achieve adequate disease control and consume 5%‐15% of annual health care budgets. Previous studies verified that pharmaceutical care is useful for achieving adequate disease control in diabetes and hypertension. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the economic cost and the incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality‐adjusted life‐year (QALY) of pharmaceutical care in the management of diabetes and hypertension in elderly patients in a primary public health care system in a developing country. METHODS: A 36‐month randomized controlled clinical trial was performed with 200 patients who were divided into a control group (n = 100) and an intervention group (n = 100). The control group received the usual care offered by the Primary Health Care Unit (medical and nurse consultations). The intervention group received the usual care plus a pharmaceutical care intervention. The intervention and control groups were compared with regard to the direct costs of health services (i.e., general practitioner, specialist, nurse, and pharmacist appointments; emergency room visits; and drug therapy costs) and the ICER per QALY. These evaluations used the health system perspective. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found between the intervention and control groups in total direct health care costs ($281.97 +/‐ $49.73 per patient vs. $212.28 +/‐ $43.49 per patient, respectively; P = 0.089); pharmaceutical care added incremental costs of $69.60 (+/‐ $7.90) per patient. The ICER per QALY was $53.50 (95% CI = $51.60‐ $54.00; monetary amounts are given in U.S. dollars). Every clinical parameter evaluated improved for the pharmaceutical care group, whereas these clinical parameters remained unchanged in the usual care group. The difference in differences (DID) tests indicated that for each clinical parameter, the patients in the intervention group improved more from pre to post than the control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: While pharmaceutical care did not significantly increase total direct health care costs, significantly improved health outcomes were seen. The mean ICER per QALY gained suggests a favorable cost‐effectiveness.

AB  - Objectives: The Hyperlink trial tested a 12‐month intervention of home blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring with pharmacist case management in adults with uncontrolled hypertension. The intervention resulted in improved BP control compared with usual care at both 6 (72% vs. 45%; P < 0.001) and 12 months (71% vs. 53%; P = 0.005). We sought to investigate factors contributing to intervention success. Design: Mixed‐methods analysis of process of care data, patient focus groups, and pharmacist interviews. Participants: Data from 228 intervention patients were examined from the original 450 patients randomly assigned from 16 primary care clinics. Five patient focus groups and 4 pharmacist interviews were conducted to ascertain the patient and pharmacist perspective. Focus group and interview data were coded, and themes relevant to pharmacists were identified. Outcome measures: Home BP readings of less than 135/85 mm Hg and patient focus group and pharmacist interview themes. Results: Mean BP at the intake visit was 148/85 mm Hg. Antihypertensive medications were adjusted in 10% of patients at the initial in‐person visit, 33% at phone visit 1, 36% at phone visit 2, and 19% at phone visit 3. Thereafter, medication changes declined. The mean home BP for patients at the first phone visit was 136/80 mm Hg, 126/74 mm Hg at 3 months, and 123/73 mm Hg at 5 months, with little change thereafter. Key components of success from patient and pharmacist interviews included a strong patient–pharmacist relationship, individualized treatment plans, and frequent phone contact with the pharmacist. Conclusion: Frequent adjustments to the antihypertensive treatment regimen based on home BP telemonitoring resulted in rapid lowering of BP. Our results suggest that an intensive telephone‐based intervention with the key components of medication adjustments, a strong patient and pharmacist relationship, and individualized treatment plans can achieve BP control in only 3 months in many patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Only about half of patients with high blood pressure (BP) in the United States have their BP controlled. Practical, robust, and sustainable models are needed to improve BP control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an intervention combining home BP telemonitoring with pharmacist case management improves BP control compared with usual care and to determine whether BP control is maintained after the intervention is stopped. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A cluster randomized clinical trial of 450 adults with uncontrolled BP recruited from 14,692 patients with electronic medical records across 16 primary care clinics in an integrated health system in Minneapolis‐St Paul, Minnesota, with 12 months of intervention and 6 months of postintervention follow‐up. INTERVENTIONS: Eight clinics were randomized to provide usual care to patients (n = 222) and 8 clinics were randomized to provide a telemonitoring intervention (n = 228). Intervention patients received home BP telemonitors and transmitted BP data to pharmacists who adjusted antihypertensive therapy accordingly. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Control of systolic BP to less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP to less than 90 mm Hg (<130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were change in BP, patient satisfaction, and BP control at 18 months (6 months after intervention stopped). RESULTS: At baseline, enrollees were 45% women, 82% white, mean (SD) age was 61.1 (12.0) years, and mean systolic BP was 148 mm Hg and diastolic BP was 85 mm Hg. Blood pressure was controlled at both 6 and 12 months in 57.2% (95% CI, 44.8% to 68.7%) of patients in the telemonitoring intervention group vs 30.0% (95% CI, 23.2% to 37.8%) of patients in the usual care group (P = .001). At 18 months (6 months of postintervention follow‐up), BP was controlled in 71.8% (95% CI, 65.0% to 77.8%) of patients in the telemonitoring intervention group vs 57.1% (95% CI, 51.5% to 62.6%) of patients in the usual care group (P = .003). Compared with the usual care group, systolic BP decreased more from baseline among patients in the telemonitoring intervention group at 6 months (‐10.7 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐14.3 to ‐7.3 mm Hg]; P<.001), at 12 months (‐9.7 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐13.4 to ‐6.0 mm Hg]; P<.001), and at 18 months (‐6.6 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐10.7 to ‐2.5 mm Hg]; P = .004). Compared with the usual care group, diastolic BP decreased more from baseline among patients in the telemonitoring intervention group at 6 months (‐6.0 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐8.6 to ‐3.4 mm Hg]; P<.001), at 12 months (‐5.1 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐7.4 to ‐2.8 mm Hg]; P<.001), and at 18 months (‐3.0 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐6.3 to 0.3 mm Hg]; P = .07). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Home BP telemonitoring and pharmacist case management achieved better BP control compared with usual care during 12 months of intervention that persisted during 6 months of postintervention follow‐up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with diabetes have poor blood pressure (BP) control. Pharmacological therapy is the cornerstone of effective BP treatment, yet there  are high rates both of poor medication adherence and failure to intensify  medications. Successful medication management requires an effective partnership  between providers who initiate and increase doses of effective medications and  patients who adhere to the regimen. METHODS: In this cluster-randomized  controlled effectiveness study, primary care teams within sites were randomized  to a program led by a clinical pharmacist trained in motivational  interviewing-based behavioral counseling approaches and authorized to make BP  medication changes or to usual care. This study involved the collection of data  during a 14-month intervention period in three Department of Veterans Affairs  facilities and two Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities. The clinical  pharmacist was supported by clinical information systems that enabled proactive  identification of, and outreach to, eligible patients identified on the basis of  poor BP control and either medication refill gaps or lack of recent medication  intensification. The primary outcome is the relative change in systolic blood  pressure (SBP) measurements over time. Secondary outcomes are changes in  Hemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), medication adherence  determined from pharmacy refill data, and medication intensification rates.  DISCUSSION: Integration of the three intervention elements--proactive  identification, adherence counseling and medication intensification--is essential  to achieve optimal levels of control for high-risk patients. Testing the  effectiveness of this intervention at the team level allows us to study the  program as it would typically be implemented within a clinic setting, including  how it integrates with other elements of care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The  ClinicalTrials.gov registration number is NCT00495794.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of community pharmacists on clinical outcomes in Hispanic patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: 126 patients were enrolled in  this longitudinal pre/post cohort study that took place in nine community and  four workplace pharmacies in San Antonio, TX. Pharmacists provided education,  point-of-care testing for glycemic and metabolic parameters, clinical assessment,  goal setting, and drug therapy management with physicians. Study outcomes were  changes in glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and accompanying metabolic parameters  (blood pressure, lipid parameters, and body mass index) during a 1-year time  frame. RESULTS: In the overall cohort, A1C was not reduced significantly from  baseline to 12 months (7.8% vs. 7.6%, P = 0.516). However, statistically  significant reductions occurred for fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, and  diastolic blood pressure. None of the other parameters was affected  significantly. In the subgroup of patients not at target values at baseline,  significant reductions occurred for A1C (9.2% vs. 8.6%, P = 0.001), systolic  blood pressure (147 vs. 143 mm Hg, P = 0.031), diastolic blood pressure (91 vs.  87 mm Hg, P < 0.001), triglycerides (259 vs. 219 mg/dL, P < 0.001), LDL  cholesterol (139 vs. 123 mg/dL, P < 0.001), and total cholesterol (237 vs. 222  mg/dL, P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Interventions performed by community pharmacists  are effective in improving clinical outcomes in a Hispanic cohort with diabetes.  Pharmacists' efforts were most successful in patients not at target glycemic and  metabolic levels.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of integrated care for chronic physical diseases and depression in reducing disability and improving quality of life.  DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial of multi-condition collaborative care for  depression and poorly controlled diabetes and/or risk factors for coronary heart  disease compared with usual care among middle aged and elderly people SETTING:  Fourteen primary care clinics in Seattle, Washington. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with  diabetes or coronary heart disease, or both, and blood pressure above 140/90 mm  Hg, low density lipoprotein concentration >3.37 mmol/L, or glycated haemoglobin  8.5% or higher, and PHQ-9 depression scores of ≥ 10. INTERVENTION: A 12 month  intervention to improve depression, glycaemic control, blood pressure, and lipid  control by integrating a "treat to target" programme for diabetes and risk  factors for coronary heart disease with collaborative care for depression. The  intervention combined self management support, monitoring of disease control, and  pharmacotherapy to control depression, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and  hyperlipidaemia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Social role disability (Sheehan  disability scale), global quality of life rating, and World Health Organization  disability assessment schedule (WHODAS-2) scales to measure disabilities in  activities of daily living (mobility, self care, household maintenance). RESULTS:  Of 214 patients enrolled (106 intervention and 108 usual care), disability and  quality of life measures were obtained for 97 intervention patients at six months  (92%) and 92 at 12 months (87%), and for 96 usual care patients at six months  (89%) and 92 at 12 months (85%). Improvements from baseline on the Sheehan  disability scale (-0.9, 95% confidence interval -1.5 to -0.2; P = 0.006) and  global quality of life rating (0.7, 0.2 to 1.2; P = 0.005) were significantly  greater at six and 12 months in patients in the intervention group. There was a  trend toward greater improvement in disabilities in activities of daily living  (-1.5, -3.3 to 0.4; P = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Integrated care that covers chronic  physical disease and comorbid depression can reduce social role disability and  enhance global quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if a multimodal intervention composed of patient education, home blood pressure (BP) monitoring, BP measurement reporting to an  interactive voice response (IVR) phone system, and clinical pharmacist follow-up  improves BP control compared with usual care. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study  with patient enrollment, medication consultation and adjustment, remote BP  monitoring, and follow-up at 6 months. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial  was conducted at 3 healthcare systems in Denver, Colorado, including a large  health maintenance organization, a Veterans Affairs medical center, and a county  hospital. At each site, patients with uncontrolled BP were randomized to the  multimodal intervention vs usual care for 6 months, with the primary end point of  BP reduction. RESULTS: Of 338 patients randomized, 283 (84%) completed the study,  including 138 intervention patients and 145 usual care patients. Baseline BP was  higher in the intervention group vs the usual care group (150.5/89.4 vs  143.8/85.3 mm Hg). At 6 months, BPs were similar in the intervention group vs the  usual care group (137.4 vs 136.7 mm Hg, P = .85 for systolic; 82.9 vs 81.1 mm Hg,  P = .14 for diastolic). However, BP reductions were greater in the intervention  group vs the usual care group (−13.1 vs −7.1 mm Hg, P = .006 for systolic; −6.5  vs −4.2 mm Hg, P = .07 for diastolic). Adherence to medications was similar  between the 2 groups, but intervention patients had a greater increase in  medication regimen intensity. CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal intervention of patient  education, home BP monitoring, BP measurement reporting to an IVR system, and  clinical pharmacist follow-up achieved greater reductions in BP compared with  usual care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of medication therapy management on chronic disease management and generic drug prescribing in the clinic setting. METHODS:  Private insurer initiates Pay-for-Performance (PFP) project for clinic-based  pharmacists in Iowa and South Dakota (n = 9 clinics) in 2009. Each pharmacist was  assigned ∽300 patients with at least 1 of 4 disease states (diabetes mellitus,  hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and asthma). Pharmacists were expected to complete  2 medication reviews for each patient. The primary outcome was frequency of  patients achieving goal levels: diabetes: hemoglobin A1c (A1c) <8%, low-density  lipoprotein (LDL) <130 mg/dL, and blood pressure (BP) <140/80 mm Hg;  hypertension: BP <140/90 mm Hg; hyperlipidemia: LDL <130 mg/dL; and asthma:  percentage of persistent asthmatics on controller medication. Generic prescribing  rates were evaluated for antihypertensives, cholesterol-lowering agents, proton  pump inhibitors, and antidepressants. RESULTS: A total of 827 patients at 3  clinics were included in the analysis. For diabetes, 77.1% had A1c <8%, 83.2% had  LDL <130 mg/dL, and 76.3% had BP <140/80 mm Hg. For hypertension, 86.2% had BP  <140/90 mm Hg. For hyperlipidemia, 80.6% had LDL <130 mg/dL. For asthma, 100%  were on controller medication. One medication review was completed on 88.8% of  patients. Generic prescribing rates ranged from 65.8% to 79.4%.  IMPLICATIONS/ADAPTABILITY: A high percentage of patients achieved goal levels at  clinics with clinical pharmacist services. A multidisciplinary approach to  patient care may improve disease state management and medication cost savings.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess whether VA MEDIC-E (Veterans Affairs Multi-disciplinary Education and Diabetes Intervention for Cardiac risk reduction[EM DASH] Extended  for 6 months), a pharmacist-led shared medical appointments program, could  improve attainment of target goals for hypertension, hyperglycemia,  hyperlipidemia, and tobacco use in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to  standard primary care after 6 months of intervention. METHODS: A randomized,  controlled trial of VA MEDIC-E (n = 50) versus standard primary care (n = 49) in  veterans with type 2 diabetes, hemoglobin A1c (A1C) > 7%, blood pressure (BP) >  130/80 mmHg, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > 100mg/dl (2.59  mmol/l) in the previous 6 months was conducted. The VA MEDIC-E intervention  consisted of 4 weekly group sessions followed by 5 monthly booster group  sessions. Each 2-hour session included 1 hour of multidisciplinary diabetes  specific healthy lifestyle education and 1 hour of pharmacotherapeutic  interventions performed by a clinical pharmacist. Evaluation measures included  lab values of A1C, LDL cholesterol, BP, and goal attainment of these values, and  diabetes self-care behavior questionnaires at 6 months. RESULTS: The  randomization groups were similar at baseline in all cardiovascular risk factors  except for LDL, which was significantly lower in the MEDIC-E arm. At 6 months,  significant improvements from baseline were found in the intervention arm for  exercise, foot care, and goal attainment of A1C, LDL-C, and BP but not in the  control arm. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the  pharmacist-led group intervention program for 6 months was an efficacious and  sustainable collaborative care approach to managing diabetes and reducing  associated cardiovascular risk.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a diabetes education program that includes a pharmacist as a member of the diabetes management team by  assessing the change in hemoglobin A1c (A1C), cholesterol, and blood pressure for  patients with type 2 diabetes in outpatient clinics. METHODS: This was a  retrospective study in outpatient clinics at Shands Jacksonville Medical Center.  The patients were assigned into either the pharmacist group or the nonpharmacist  group, according to the presence or the absence of a pharmacist in the clinic.  The primary end point was the absolute change in A1C versus baseline. Secondary  end points included change in cholesterol and blood pressure and the number of  patients to attain American Diabetes Association goals. End points were recorded  to correlate within 3 months of the initial visit and final visit with a  provider. RESULTS: Compared to the nonpharmacist group, patients in the  pharmacist group had more advanced and uncontrolled diabetes at baseline. The  pharmacist group showed a greater percent change in A1C and improvement between  the initial and final clinic visits, after adjusting for baseline confounders.  Despite the statistically significant improvement in A1C in the pharmacist group,  there was no difference found between the 2 groups for the end points of  cholesterol and blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Including a pharmacist as a part of  the diabetes management team may result in lower A1C in patients with more  advanced and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus versus a health care team  without a pharmacist.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To further develop and evaluate a diabetes disease state management (DSM) program that provided direct patient care responsibilities to advanced  pharmacy practice experience (APPE) students as members of healthcare teams.  DESIGN: Nine new clinics and 3 established sites that provide self-care  management education to patients with diabetes were established and maintained in  rural Colorado pharmacies and supported by students in APPE training for 48 weeks  per year. EVALUATION: The 12 clinics provided 120 APPE student placements in  2010-2011. Students' perceptions of their experiences were positive. Patients who  completed the student-supported diabetes self-management education program had  improvements in blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid values. CONCLUSIONS:  Twelve diabetes DSM clinics provided direct patient care opportunities to APPE  students working as part of healthcare teams while expanding healthcare resources  in underserved communities in Colorado.

AB  - PURPOSE: The impact of pharmacist management of patients with diabetes mellitus enrolled in a rural free clinic was evaluated. METHODS: Data from 95 patients  continuously enrolled in a new pharmacist service were analyzed over 24 months.  Patients were at least 18 years old, qualified for free care on the basis of  income or insurance status, and had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus upon  clinic entry. Under a collaborative agreement, pharmacists educated patients on  diabetes, counseled patients on lifestyle modifications, assessed appropriateness  of drug therapy, and managed drug therapy for diabetes and associated comorbid  conditions. Clinical impact was measured by changes from baseline glycosylated  hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels, blood pressure, and lipid levels over a 24-month  period. Using published cost estimates, the economic impact of the clinic was  calculated based on expected savings for each patient who had a decrease of ≥1%  in HbA(1c) value. RESULTS: Significant reductions from baseline in HbA1c values  (p < 0.0001), systolic blood pressure (p = 0.0011), diastolic blood pressure (p =  0.0015), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.0001), and triglyceride  levels (p = 0.0001) were achieved in clinic patients. Based on an expected  savings of $1,118 per patient who had a decrease of >1% in HbA(1c) value (n =  67), the pharmacist service was estimated to provide a savings of $74,906 per  year. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist management of patients with type 2 diabetes  significantly influenced clinical and economic outcomes in an uninsured  population living in a rural area with few health care resources.

AB  - PURPOSE: Value-based insurance designs (VBID) have been developed by health insurance companies and used by employers to allocate health care resources  appropriately and to lower patients' out-of-pocket costs for services related to  chronic conditions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the  Cincinnati Pharmacy Coaching Program (CPCP) on clinical and economic outcomes.  The CPCP is a VBID implemented by Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield in Ohio. It  provided tailored pharmacist-based educational services and financial incentives  to participants. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental pre/post longitudinal  study in which patients were identified as they enrolled in the CPCP between Jan.  1, 2008, and Dec. 31, 2009. Patients could participate in a Diabetes Coaching  Program (DCP) or a Heart Healthy Coaching Program (HHCP). Control subjects were  selected from patients who were invited but did not choose to participate.  Control subjects were matched to intervention cohorts using propensity score  matching. Clinical (blood pressure, lipid levels, and hemoglobin A1c) and  economic (all-cause and disease-attributable) outcomes were evaluated using  within-subject (pre-post) and between-subject comparison (intervention-control)  design. RESULTS: A total of 607 patients were enrolled in intervention groups,  and 557 control subjects were selected after matching. Significant reductions  were found in blood pressure, lipid levels, and hemoglobin A1c after enrollment,  and a significantly greater proportion of patients, compared with controls,  achieved their clinical goals according to national guidelines in both programs.  Hypertension-related cost trends were favorable for HHCP relative to the control  cohort. Diabetes-related costs increased for all groups from pre- to post-index,  largely driven by office visits and medication costs in the DCP and inpatient/ER  visits in the control cohort. CONCLUSION: Results showed significant improvements  in all diabetes- and hypertension-related clinical measures. This study shows the  effect of a comprehensive VBID on the health of patients with chronic disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with high blood pressure (BP) visit a physician an average of 4 times or more per year in the U.S., yet BP is controlled in fewer than half.  Practical, robust and sustainable models are needed to improve BP in patients  with uncontrolled hypertension. OBJECTIVES: The Home Blood Pressure  Telemonitoring and Case Management to Control Hypertension study (HyperLink) is a  cluster-randomized trial designed to determine whether an intervention that  combines home BP telemonitoring with pharmacist case management improves BP  control compared to usual care at 6 and 12 months in patients with uncontrolled  hypertension. Secondary outcomes are maintenance of BP control at 18 months,  patient satisfaction with their health care, and costs of care. METHODS:  HyperLink enrolled 450 hypertensive patients with uncontrolled BP from 16 primary  care clinics. Eight clinics were randomized to provide usual care (UC) to their  patients (n=222) and 8 were randomized to provide the telemonitoring intervention  (TI) (n=228). TI patients received home BP telemonitors that internally store and  electronically transmit BP data to a secure database. Pharmacist case managers  adjust antihypertensive therapy based on the home BP data under a collaborative  practice agreement with the clinics' primary care teams. The length of the  intervention is 12 months, with follow-up to 18 months to determine the  durability of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: We will test in a real primary care  setting whether combining BP telemonitoring and pharmacist case management can  achieve and maintain high rates of BP control compared to usual care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to cardioprotective medications in the year after acute coronary syndrome hospitalization is generally poor and is associated with  increased risk of rehospitalization and mortality. Few interventions have  specifically targeted this high-risk patient population to improve medication  adherence. We hypothesize that a multifaceted patient-centered intervention could  improve adherence to cardioprotective medications. METHODS AND RESULTS: To  evaluate this intervention, we propose enrolling 280 patients with a recent acute  coronary syndrome event into a multicenter randomized, controlled trial. The  intervention comprises 4 main components: (1) pharmacist-led medication  reconciliation and tailoring; (2) patient education; (3) collaborative care  between pharmacist and primary care provider/cardiologist; and (4) 2 types of  voice messaging (educational and medication refill reminder calls). Patients in  the intervention arm will visit with the study pharmacist ≈1 week post-hospital  discharge. The pharmacist will work with the patient and collaborate with  providers to reconcile medication issues. Voice messages will augment the  educational process and remind patients to refill their cardioprotective  medications. The study will compare the intervention versus usual care for 12  months. The primary outcome of interest is adherence using the ReComp method.  Secondary and tertiary outcomes include achievement of targets for blood pressure  and low-density lipoprotein, and reduction in the combined cardiovascular end  points of myocardial infarction hospitalization, coronary revascularization, and  all-cause mortality. Finally, we will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the  intervention compared with usual care. CONCLUSIONS: If the intervention is  effective in improving medication adherence and demonstrating a lower cost, the  intervention has the potential to improve cardiovascular outcomes in this  high-risk patient population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated in previous studies that pharmacist management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the outpatient  setting not only improves diabetes-related clinical outcomes such as hemoglobin  A1c but also blood pressure (BP), total cholesterol (TC), and quality of life.  Improved control of BP and TC has been shown to reduce the risks of  cardiovascular disease (CVD), which has placed a heavy economic burden on the  health care system. However, no study has evaluated the cost-effectiveness of  pharmacist intervention programs with respect to the long-term preventive effects  on CVD outcomes among T2DM patients. OBJECTIVES: To (a) quantify the long-term  preventive effects of pharmacist intervention on CVD outcomes among T2DM patients  using evidence from a matched cohort study in the outpatient primary care setting  and (b) assess the relative cost-effectiveness of adding a clinical pharmacist to  the primary care team for the management of patients with T2DM based on  improvement in CVD risks with the aid of an economic model. METHODS: Clinical  data between the periods of June 2007 to February 2010 were collected from  electronic medical records at 2 separate clinics at Kaiser Permanente (KP)  Northern California, 1 with primary care physicians only (control group) and the  other with the addition of a pharmacist (enhanced care group). Patients in the  enhanced care group were matched 1:1 with patients in the control group according  to baseline characteristics that included age, gender, A1c, and Charlson  comorbidity score. The estimated 10-year CVD risk for both groups was calculated  by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine (version 2)  based on age, sex, race, smoking status, atrial fibrillation, duration of  diabetes, levels of A1c, systolic BP (SBP) and TC, and high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (HDL-C) observed at 12 months. There was no statistical difference in  the baseline clinical inputs to the Risk Engine (A1c [P=0.115], SBP [P=0.184], TC  [P=0.055], and HDL-C [P=0.475]) between the 2 groups. A Markov model was  developed to simulate the estimated CVD outcomes over 10 years and to estimate  cost-effectiveness. The final outcomes examined included incremental cost and  effectiveness measured by life years and per quality-adjusted life year gained.  Both deterministic sensitivity analysis (SA) and probabilistic SA were conducted  to examine the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The estimated risks for  coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke (both nonfatal and fatal) at the end of  the follow-up were consistently lower in the enhanced care group compared with  the control group, even though baseline risks in both groups were similar. The  absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the enhanced care and control groups  increased over time. For example, the ARR for nonfatal CHD risk in year 1 was  0.5% (1.2% vs. 0.7%), whereas the ARR increased to 5.5% in year 10 (14.8% vs.  9.3%). Similarly, the ARR between the enhanced care and the control groups was  calculated as 0.3% for fatal CHD in year 1 and increased to 4.6% in year 10.  Results from the Markov model suggest that the enhanced care group was shown to  be a dominant strategy (less expensive and more effective) compared with the  control group in the 10-year evaluation period in the base-case (average or mean  results) scenario. Sensitivity analysis that took into account the uncertainty in  all important variables, such as wage of pharmacists, utility weight (the degree  of preference individuals have for a particular health state or condition),  response rate to pharmacists' care, and uncertainty associated with the estimated  10 years of CVD risk, revealed that the relative value of enhanced care was  robust to most of the variations in these parameters. Notably, the level of  cost-effectiveness measured by net monetary value depends on the time horizon  adopted by the payers and the magnitude of CVD risk reduction. The enhanced care  group has a higher chance of being considered as a cost-effective strategy when a  longer time horizon such as a minimum of 4 to 5 years is adopted. CONCLUSIONS:  Adding pharmacists to the health care management team for diabetic patients  improves the long-term CVD risks. The longer-term CVD risk reductions were shown  to be more dramatic than the short-term reduction. A longer time horizon adopted  by health plans in managing T2DM patients has a higher probability of making the  intervention cost-effective.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Hypertension control for large populations remains a major challenge. OBJECTIVE: To describe a large-scale hypertension program in Northern California  and to compare rates of hypertension control in that program with statewide and  national estimates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The Kaiser Permanente Northern  California (KPNC) hypertension program included a multifaceted approach to blood  pressure control. Patients identified as having hypertension within an integrated  health care delivery system in Northern California from 2001-2009 were included.  The comparison group comprised insured patients in California between 2006-2009  who were included in the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set  (HEDIS) commercial measurement by California health insurance plans participating  in the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) quality measure reporting  process. A secondary comparison group was included to obtain the reported  national mean NCQA HEDIS commercial rates of hypertension control between  2001-2009 from health plans that participated in the NCQA HEDIS quality measure  reporting process. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hypertension control as defined by  NCQA HEDIS. RESULTS: The KPNC hypertension registry included 349,937 patients  when established in 2001 and increased to 652,763 by 2009. The NCQA HEDIS  commercial measurement for hypertension control within KPNC increased from 43.6%  (95% CI, 39.4%-48.6%) to 80.4% (95% CI, 75.6%-84.4%) during the study period  (P < .001 for trend). In contrast, the national mean NCQA HEDIS commercial  measurement increased from 55.4% to 64.1%. California mean NCQA HEDIS commercial  rates of hypertension were similar to those reported nationally from 2006-2009  (63.4% to 69.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults diagnosed with  hypertension, implementation of a large-scale hypertension program was associated  with a significant increase in hypertension control compared with state and  national control rates. Key elements of the program included a comprehensive  hypertension registry, development and sharing of performance metrics,  evidence-based guidelines, medical assistant visits for blood pressure  measurement, and single-pill combination pharmacotherapy.

AB  - Purpose. The implementation and outcomes of a program combining electronic home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) and pharmacist-provided medication therapy management (MTM) services in a renal transplantation clinic are described. Summary. Patients enrolled in the program were provided with a computer-enabled blood pressure monitor. A dedicated renal transplantation pharmacist was integrated into the renal transplantation team under a collaborative care practice agreement. The collaborative care agreement allowed the pharmacist to authorize medication additions, deletions, and dosage changes. Comprehensive disease and blood pressure education was provided by a clinical pharmacist. In the pretrans-plantation setting, the pharmacist interviewed the renal transplant candidate and documents allergies, verified the patient's medication profile, and identified and assessed barriers to medication adherence. A total of 50 renal transplant recipients with at least one recorded home blood pressure reading and at least one year of follow-up were included in our analysis. A significant reduction in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were observed at 30, 90,180, and 360 days after enrollment in the program (p < 0.05). Pharmacist interventions were documented for 37 patients. Medication-related problems accounted for 46% of these interventions and included dosage modifications, regimen changes, and mitigation of barriers to medication access and adherence. Conclusion. Implementation of electronic HBPM and pharmacist-provided MTM services implemented in a renal transplant clinic was associated with sustained improvements in blood pressure control. Incorporation of a pharmacist in the renal transplant clinic resulted in the detection and resolution of medication-related problems.

AB  - Background: The impact of pharmacist-led transition of care services with collaborative drug therapy management has shown to improve patients' outcomes and decrease health costs. Compelling statistics show higher readmission rates for under-insured patients compared with insured patients at primary health care clinics. Methods: This is a single center, prospective, cohort study designed to examine team-based collaborative drug therapy management and its effect on therapeutic outcomes of under-insured patients with target chronic diseases managed in a primary health center. Targeted chronic diseases included dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, anticoagulation disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure. The primary outcome measures included percentage of time in therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) and percentage of patients at targeted goals of blood pressure, lipids, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes included reduced emergency department visits, number of patient encounters, hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge, and disease exacerbation rates. Results: Patients were at INR goal 58% of the time compared with 52% at baseline (P =.66). There was a 9% improvement in mean HbA1c in the intervention group when compared with baseline (9.6% vs 10.9%, P =.03). With pharmacist intervention, 73.8% of the patients had their blood pressure at goal compared with 50% at baseline (P =.14). A limited number of patients were readmitted for different reasons, including uncontrolled disease states. Conclusions: The pharmacist-physician collaborative drug therapy management led to improved blood pressure control, average HbA1c, and time in therapeutic INR range. A decrease in health care utilization was also identified.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the clinical and humanistic outcomes of a community pharmacist-involved collaborative care model in diabetes management.Methods: This was a parallel arm, open-label, multi-centre randomized controlled trial conducted over 6 months. Subjects with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c ≥ 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and taking ≥ 5 medications were included. Participants were randomized into intervention (collaborative care) and control groups (physician-centric care). The intervention included medication therapy management and telephonic follow-up with visits to family physicians, nurses, and dietitians. Clinical outcomes included changes in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure (SBP), lipids, and hypoglycaemic incidences. Humanistic outcomes included self-care capabilities and quality of life. Linear mixed models were constructed. Intention-to-treat analyses, with sensitivity analyses, were conducted.Results: A total of 264 participants were randomized (intervention: 131, control: 133). Significantly greater reduction in HbA1c was observed in the intervention group (intervention: -0.32% (-3.52 mmol/mol) vs. control: -0.06% (-0.66 mmol/mol), p = 0.038). Changes in SBP, lipids, and incidences of hypoglycaemia were not significant over 6 months between both groups. Significantly greater improvements in self-management (p < 0.001) and quality of life (p = 0.003) were observed within the intervention group.Conclusion: Partnering community pharmacists in a collaborative care team improved glycaemic control, quality of life and self-care capabilities of patients with diabetes and polypharmacy.

AB  - Background: Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease in the United States and is costing the health care system billions of dollars annually. A health program that combines education, empowerment, and monitoring has shown to improve clinical outcomes and decrease overall health care costs.Objective: To describe the implementation and effectiveness of a self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) program in a community pharmacy.Practice Description: An independent community pharmacy located within rural Southeast Missouri. On-site community pharmacists provide medication therapy management, adherence monitoring, immunizations, and reimbursed clinical services.Practice Innovation: Patients were eligible if they were older than 18 years of age and fell into one of the following categories: self-reported a new hypertension diagnosis, self-reported a desire to SMBP, were referred by a provider, or had a medication change within the 3 months before enrollment. The program consisted of 4 patient sessions. The first session obtained an initial blood pressure and provided patient education and behavior counseling. Follow-up sessions obtained average SMBP readings and reinforced previously learned concepts.Evaluation Methods: Implementation was evaluated using time and patient satisfaction. Effectiveness was evaluated using number and type of clinical problems identified, BP measurements, and test scores.Results: A total of 20 patients enrolled and completed the study. The program took 63 minutes (SD ± 18) of staff time per patient for recruitment, sessions, reminder calls, and documentation. All patients received education and monitoring and 11 additional clinical problems were documented. Systolic BP decreased an average of 17 mm Hg (P = 0.002), and diastolic BP decreased an average of 12 mm Hg (P < 0.001). Patient confidence scores increased by 14%, and 7 more patients correctly answered the post-test knowledge question. All patients reported overall satisfaction with the program as "satisfied" or "very satisfied."Conclusion: This standardized SMBP program effectively improved hypertension control and patient confidence in managing BP.

AB  - Introduction: Appropriate management of chronic diseases, including proper use of medications, can lead to better disease control, decrease disease-related complications, and improve overall health. Pharmacists have been shown to positively affect chronic disease outcomes through medication therapy management (MTM). The primary objectives of this project are to increase the number of patients with (1) A1c in control and (2) blood pressure in control; secondary objectives are to (3) describe number and type of medication-related problems identified and resolved by pharmacists providing MTM in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), (4) identify potential (pADEs) and actual adverse drug events (ADEs), and refer patients to diabetes self-management education classes, as needed. Methods: This multisite, prospective, descriptive pilot study engaged three FQHC sites with distinct models of established pharmacist MTM services to care for patients with uncontrolled diabetes and/or hypertension. Data were reported in aggregate regarding primary and secondary outcomes. Results: As of December 2015, 706 patients were enrolled in the project. Of the 422 with uncontrolled diabetes, 52.84% (n = 223) had an A1c <9%; 72 patients (17.06%) achieved an A1c between 8% and 9%, 19.19% (n = 81) of patients achieved an A1c <8% and ≥7%, and 16.59% (n = 70) of patients achieved an A1c <7%. The percentage of patients with blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg improved to 65.21%. Conclusion: Pharmacist-provided MTM can improve chronic disease intermediate outcomes for medically underserved patients in FQHCs.

AB  - Background: Nonadherence to medications by patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) leads to unfavorable clinical outcomes. Limited data exist to demonstrate the effect of incorporating patient-centered interventions using concepts of medication therapy management and motivational interview by pharmacists on pharmacoadherence in patients requiring HD. Therefore, we assessed the impact of patient-centered pharmacist care on pharmacoadherence and its outcomes in patients requiring HD.Methods: Adult patients who had received outpatient HD for at least 3 months were enrolled. The study was conducted from October 2016 to April 2017. Pharmacists interviewed the patients at month 1, 2, 4 and 6, and the intervention (comprehensive review) occurred at months 3 and 5. The primary outcome was the change in pharmacoadherence as assessed by pre-HD serum phosphate levels and the differences in the number of medications between patient' self-report and medications records at the electronic healthcare records (EHRs). The secondary outcomes included changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), glycosylated hemoglobin levels, serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and the prevalence and types of medication-related problems (MRPs).Results: Seventy-two patients were enrolled. Their median age was 59 (interquartile range: 47-67.5) years, and 53% were men. Pre- and post-intervention pharmacoadherence, as indicated by serum phosphate levels and the differences in the number of medications between patient' self-report and the medication records at the EHRs, did not significantly differ (p = 0.682 and 0.348, respectively). Mean SBP and mean LDL did not significantly change post-intervention. The median number of MRPs declined between Months 3 and 5 (p = 0.002): the prevalence of MRPs at Month 3 was 44.9% (95 confidence interval [CI]: 40.4-49.3) and decreased to 29.8% (95 CI: 25.6-34.3) at Month 5. Drug use without indication was the most frequent MRP (23.9%).Conclusions: Patient-centered pharmacist care did not result in significant changes in pharmacoadherence. However, its clinical utility as a tool to identify and mitigate MRPs in patients requiring HD is indisputable.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03576404 (retrospectively registered on July 3rd, 2018).

AB  - The objective of this prospective, pre-post longitudinal study was to assess the impact of pharmacist-provided medication therapy management (MTM) services on employees' health and well-being by evaluating their clinical and humanistic outcomes. City of Toledo employees and/or their spouses and dependents with diabetes with or without comorbid conditions were enrolled in the pharmacist-conducted MTM program. Participants scheduled consultations with the pharmacist at predetermined intervals. Overall health outcomes, such as clinical markers, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disease knowledge, and social and process measures, were documented at these visits and assessed for improvement. Changes in patient outcomes over time were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank and Friedman test at an a priori level of 0.05. Spearman correlation was used to measure the relationship between clinical and humanistic outcomes. A total of 101 patients enrolled in the program. At the end of 1 year, patients' A1c levels decreased on average by 0.27 from their baseline values. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure also decreased on average by 6.0 and 4.2 mmHg, respectively. Patient knowledge of disease conditions and certain aspects or components of HRQoL also improved. Improvements in social and process measures also were also observed. Improved clinical outcomes and quality of life can affect employee productivity and help reduce costs for employers by reducing disease-related missed days of work. Employers seeking to save costs and impact productivity can utilize the services provided by pharmacists. ( Population Health Management 2014;17:21-27)

AB  - Purpose: A collaborative pharmacist-primary care provider (PharmD-PCP) team approach to medicationtherapy management (MTM), with pharmacists initiating and changing medications at separate office visits, holds promise for the cost-effective management of hypertension, but has not been evaluated in many systematic trials. The primary objective of this study was to examine blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive patients managed by a newly formed PharmD-PCP MTM team versus usual care in a university-based primary care clinic. Methods: This randomized, pragmatic clinical trial was conducted in hypertensive patients randomly selected for PharmD-PCP MTM or usual care. In the PharmD-PCP MTM group, pharmacists managed drug-therapy initiation and monitoring, medication adjustments, biometric assessments, laboratory tests, and patient education. In the usual-care group, patients continued to see their PCPs. Participants were aged >/=18 years, were diagnosed with hypertension, had a most recent BP measurement of >/=140/ >/=90 mm Hg (>/=130/ >/=80 mm Hg if codiagnosed with diabetes mellitus), were on at least 1 antihypertensive medication, and were English speaking. The primary outcome was the difference in the mean change from baseline in systolic BP at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the percentage achieving therapeutic BP goal and the mean changes from baseline in diastolic BP and lowand high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Findings: A total of 166 patients were enrolled (69 men; mean age, 67.7 years; PharmD-PCP MTM group, n = 75; usual-care group, n = 91). Mean reduction in SBP was significantly greater in the PharmD-PCP MTM group at 6 months (-7.1 [19.4] vs +1.6 [21.0] mm Hg; P = 0.008), but the difference was no longer statistically significant at 9 months (-5.2 [16.9] vs -1.7 [17.7] mm Hg; P = 0.22), based on an intent-to-treat analysis. In the intervention group, greater percentages of patients who continued to see the MTM pharmacist versus those who returned to their PCP were at goal at 6 months (81% vs 44%) and at 9 months (70% vs 52%). No significant betweengroup differences in changes in cholesterol were detected at 6 and 9 months; however, the mean baseline values were near recommended levels. The PharmD-PCP MTM group had significantly fewer PCP visits compared with the usual-care group (1.8 [1.5] vs 4.2 [1.0]; P o 0.001). Implications: A PharmD-PCP collaborative MTM service was more effective in lowering BP than was usual care at 6 months in all patients and at 9 months in patients who continued to see the pharmacist. Incorporating pharmacists into the primary care team may be a successful strategy for managing medication therapy, improving patient outcomes and possibly extending the capacity of primary care.

AB  - About one in ten Americans has type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Poorly managed diabetes causes serious complications that diminish quality of life and life expectancy, with substantial cost to the healthcare system and patients. Pharmacists are well-equipped to provide medication therapy management (MTM) services for managing diabetes, but cost-effectiveness of MTM is not known. Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MTMC, versus no MTMC, for treating patients with T2DM. Methods: Clinical data for 78 individuals with T2DM treated at University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System’s MTMC during 2001-2012 were collected from electronic medical records. A control group with the same characteristics was simulated. Adjusted difference-in-difference estimates of -0.63 for HbA1c and -8.21 for systolic blood pressure, both favoring MTMC (versus no MTMC), were obtained from a previously published study on one-year impact of MTMC in the same patient sample. UKPDS Outcomes Model was used to obtain annual T2DM complication rates over ten years for both groups. Costs and utilities for T2DM complications, obtained from published literature, were applied to those with each complication in each year. Primary outcomes, discounted at 3% annually, included total costs (TC) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate uncertainty. Results: All results reported are over ten years. Without considering MTM service costs, MTMC group incurred $203,583 TC and 4.7524 QALYs. No MTMC group incurred $204,807 TC and 4.7419 QALYs. At current reimbursement rates, to be cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $150,000 per QALY gained, patients can be provided 27 and 45 MTMC visits, respectively, to reach and maintain the observed HbA1c and SBP. For every 1000 patients treated, MTMC avoided 2.10 myocardial infarctions, 6.11 strokes and 2.11 amputations. Conclusions: Current reimbursement models may need to be revised to incentivize provision of MTM services to T2DM patients.

TI  - Demonstrating the value of an innovative transitionof-care pharmacy service with quality measures and a unique way of gauging significance of pharmacy interventions

AB  - Objective: The objective is to quantify and describe outcomes achieved through an innovative clinical pharmacy service that initiates collaboration between hospital and community pharmacists and physicians to improve medication use through care transitions. Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs) are completed during hospitalization and medication-related problems (MRPs) are identified and then addressed with physicians as needed. Acute and chronic care issues are communicated with hospital and community physicians respectively. A summary of the CMR and suggested follow-up interventions or opportunities for patient education is shared with the patient's community pharmacist to facilitate ongoing medication management. The goal of this service is to improve patient outcomes by promoting safe and effective medication use. Methods: This observational study evaluated outcomes achieved during a 20-day timeframe. Eligible patients were admitted to the hospital, had multiple chronic diseases, at least five chronic medications, and a planned discharge to home. Once a CMR was completed, the hospital pharmacist communicated with the patient's hospital or community physician and community pharmacist to resolve or prevent MRPs. Data was gathered on the number of CMRs completed and the number and type of MRPs identified. Additionally, the clinical significance of each pharmacist intervention was scored on two innovative scales-criticality as related to clinical evidence and medication safety, and relevance as related to priorities of the patient. An example of high criticality would be recommending therapy such as an ACE-inhibitor in a patient with diabetes and hypertension where evidence of improved outcomes is widely accepted, or intervening to prevent a major adverse drug reaction. An intervention that is highly relevant to the patient could include issues related to cost, convenience, or improving a patient-oriented outcome such as mortality. Results: Twenty-four CMRs were completed and all but one had at least one MRP. There was an average of 1.6 corrections to the admission medication reconciliation per patient, 4.5 suggestions for the community pharmacist per patient, and 2.2 suggestions for the primary care physician per patient. Cardiovascular drugs were the most frequent class involved in a MRP (37%) followed by endocrine (18%), antithrombotic (13%) and gastrointestinal (11%) drug classes. Eleven percent of pharmacist interventions were scored as having high criticality related to clinical evidence, and 18% had both high criticality and high relevance to the patient. An example of an intervention with high criticality and relevance was identifying and resolving a MRP where a patient admitted with shortness of breath due to atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular ratewas using albuterol five times daily despite no history of pulmonary disease. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the productivity of an innovative pharmacy service focused on improving medication use and safety during care transitions. The service generated data demonstrating the need for pharmacists to complete a CMR and collaborate with hospital and community healthcare providers to resolve or prevent MRPs during error prone transitions of care. Measuring criticality related to clinical evidence and relevance to the patient is a unique strategy to describe the value of this service that has the potential to add an important dimension of information that can be used to solicit stakeholder support for clinical pharmacy services.

AB  - Background and objectives CKD is characterized by remarkably high hospitalization and readmission rates. Our study aim was to test a medication therapy management intervention to reduce subsequent acute care utilization. Design, setting, participants, & measurements The CKD Medication Intervention Trial was a single-blind (investigators), randomized clinical trial conducted at Providence Health Care in Spokane, Washington. Patients with CKD stages 3–5 not treated by dialysis who were hospitalized for acute illness were recruited. The intervention was designed to improve posthospitalization care by medication therapy management. A pharmacist delivered the intervention as a single home visit within 7 days of discharge. The intervention included these fundamental elements: comprehensive medication review, medication action plan, and a personal medication list. The primary outcome was a composite of acute care utilization (hospital readmissions and emergency department and urgent care visits) for 90 days after hospitalization. Results Baseline characteristics of participants (n=141) included the following: age, 69±11 (mean±SD) years old women, 48% (67 of 141) diabetes, 56%(79 of 141) hypertension, 83% (117 of 141) eGFR, 41±14 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (serum creatinine–based Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio median, 43 mg/g (interquartile range, 8–528) creatinine. The most common primary diagnoses for hospitalization were the following: cardiovascular events, 36% (51 of 141); infections, 18% (26 of 141); and kidney diseases, 12% (17 of 141). The primary outcome occurred in 32 of 72 (44%) of the medication intervention group and 28 of 69 (41%) of those in usual care (log rank P=0.72). For only hospital readmission, the rate was 19 of 72 (26%) in the medication intervention group and 18 of 69 (26%) in the usual care group (log rank P=0.95). There was no between-group difference in achievement of guideline-based goals for use of renin-angiotensin system inhibition or for BP, hemoglobin, phosphorus, or parathyroid hormone. Conclusions Acute care utilization after hospitalization was not reduced by a pharmacist-led medication therapy management intervention at the transition from hospital to home.

AB  - Purpose: Pharmacist-led medication therapy disease management (MTDM) has shown improvement in clinical outcomes in patients with certain chronic diseases. However, only limited data demonstrating the impact on health care utilization and cost of care are available. This study seeks to evaluate the impact of a pharmacist-led MTDM program on clinical surrogate outcomes, care utilization, and cost of care among patients with diabetes mellitus. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by utilizing electronic health records and insurance claims data. Patients were identified between February 2011 and December 2014. Data were collected from Geisinger, a large integrated health care system located in Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey. A total of 5,500 patients with diabetes mellitus were identified; 2,750 were enrolled in MTDM and were 1-to-1 propensity score-matched to a comparison cohort not enrolled in a pharmacist-led MTDM program. Results: There were no differences between groups in composite HbA1c, blood pressure, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment at 12 months (12% vs 12%, P=0.53). HbA1c goal was reached more frequently among patients without MTDM compared to those at 12 months (57% vs 51%, P<0.0001). There were no significant differences between the two cohorts in the attainment of blood pressure or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals at 12 months. MTDM was associated with reduced all-cause hospitalization rate (–19.6%; P=0.02) as well as increased primary care physician visits (18.5%; P<0.001) and lower average per-member-per-month medical cost (–13%, P=0.027). Conclusion: Despite the lack of impact on the clinical surrogate outcomes, MTDM was associated with lower cost of care and fewer hospitalizations, possibly facilitated by increased monitoring (ie, higher primary care utilization).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacist-led medication review is a collaborative service which aims to identify and resolve medication-related problems.
OBJECTIVE: To critically evaluate published systematic reviews relevant to pharmacist-led medication reviews in community settings.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) were searched from 1995 to December 2015. Systematic reviews of all study designs and outcomes were considered. Methodological quality was assessed using the 11-item Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool. Systematic reviews of moderate or high quality (AMSTAR ≥ 4) were included in the data synthesis. Data extraction and quality assessment was performed independently by two investigators.
RESULTS: Of the 35 relevant systematic reviews identified, 24 were of moderate and seven of high quality and were included in the data synthesis. The largest overall numbers of unique primary research studies with favorable outcomes were for diabetes control (78% of studies reporting the outcome), blood pressure control (74%), cholesterol (63%), medication adherence (56%) and medication management (47%). Significant reductions in medication and/or healthcare costs were reported in 35% of primary research studies. Meta-analysis was performed in 12 systematic reviews. Results from the meta-analyses suggested positive impacts on glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, cholesterol, and number and appropriateness of medications. Conflicting findings were reported in relation to hospitalization. No meta-analyses reported reduced mortality.
CONCLUSION: Moderate and high quality systematic reviews support the value of pharmacist-led medication review for a range of clinical outcomes. Further research including more rigorous cost analyses are required to determine the impact of pharmacist-led medication reviews on humanistic and economic outcomes. Future systematic reviews should consider the inclusion of both qualitative and quantitative studies to comprehensively evaluate medication review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to antihypertensive medications is suboptimal. Hospital pharmacist interventions including motivational interviewing (MI) might assist in improving adherence in patients with hypertension. For an intervention to be useful, it is important to have tools that can easily identify potential adherence problems.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate process outcomes and patient- and pharmacist-reported outcomes of a pharmacist adherence intervention for hypertensive patients treated in hospital outpatient clinics. Secondly, to determine the agreement between two different adherence metrics: an adherence questionnaire used in the intervention and a prescription-based measure.
METHODS: The development of the intervention was based on adherence and behavioral theories and evidence of effective interventions. This included a focused medication review, a patient interview, and follow-up telephone calls. Two tools were used to identify adherence problems: The Drug Adherence Work-up (DRAW) tool and an adherence questionnaire. Process data included drug-related problems (DRPs) with recommendations to the physicians, medication- and lifestyle problems identified at the patient interview, actions taken and time spent on the intervention.
RESULTS: In total, 91 DRPs in 8 categories generated recommendations to the physicians; 56 recommendations were generated at the medication review and 35 at the patient interview. At the interview, 421 problems were identified, of which 60% were medication-related and 40% lifestyle-related. In connection with the interview, 528 actions were taken within 8 different categories. MI was a central technique applicable for most problems and was employed in nearly all patients (94%). About half of the patients reported increased focus on lifestyle change, and 21-39% reported increased knowledge, confidence and skills in relation to their medication as well as better quality of life. The pharmacists found that the intervention elements were meaningful pharmacist tasks, and that the DRAW tool was easy to use and helped them focus on addressing reasons for non-adherence. The mean total time spent by the pharmacist per patient was 2 h 14 min (SD 40 min).
CONCLUSIONS: A pharmacist-led, multifaceted, tailored adherence intervention was feasible for identifying and addressing a wide range of potential adherence and lifestyle problems. Among the intervention procedures, MI was a central technique, applicable in most types of problems. The questionnaire showed relatively little value for identifying non-adherence. The intervention was well accepted both by the pharmacists and the patients, thereby increasing the likeliness of successful implementation in routine practice.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Adherence to cardioprotective medication regimens in the year after hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is poor. OBJECTIVE To test a multifaceted intervention to improve adherence to cardiac medications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this randomized clinical trial, 253 patients from 4 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers located in Denver (Colorado), Seattle (Washington); Durham (North Carolina), and Little Rock (Arkansas) admitted with ACS were randomized to the multifaceted intervention (INT) or usual care (UC) prior to discharge. INTERVENTIONS The INT lasted for 1 year following discharge and comprised (1) pharmacist-led medication reconciliation and tailoring; (2) patient education; (3) collaborative care between pharmacist and a patient's primary care clinician and/or cardiologist; and (4) 2 types of voice messaging (educational and medication refill reminder calls). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome of interestwas proportion of patients adherent to medication regimens based on a mean proportion of days covered (PDC) greater than 0.80 in the year after hospital discharge using pharmacy refill data for 4 cardioprotective medications (clopidogrel, β-blockers, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors [statins], and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers [ACEI/ARB]). Secondary outcomes included achievement of blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level targets. RESULTS Of 253 patients, 241 (95.3%) completed the study (122 in INT and 119 in UC). In the INT group, 89.3%of patients were adherent compared with 73.9%in the UC group (P = .003). Mean PDC was higher in the INT group (0.94 vs 0.87; P< .001). A greater proportion of intervention patients were adherent to clopidogrel (86.8%vs 70.7%; P = .03), statins (93.2%vs 71.3%; P < .001), and ACEI/ARB (93.1% vs 81.7%; P = .03) but not β-blockers (88.1%vs 84.8%; P = .59). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients who achieved BP and LDL-C level goals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A multifaceted intervention comprising pharmacist-led medication reconciliation and tailoring, patient education, collaborative care between pharmacist and patients' primary care clinician and/or cardiologist, and voice messaging increased adherence to medication regimens in the year after ACS hospital discharge without improving BP and LDL-C levels. Understanding the impact of such improvement in adherence on clinical outcomes is needed prior to broader dissemination of the program. Copyright © 2014 American Medical Association.

AB  - PURPOSE: Transitions of care may involve multiple medication changes that lead to uncertainty about medication regimens and potential errors. This project addressed medication related problems identified during telephone calls to patients discharged from three SNFs. METHODS: An interprofessional team, centered in an outpatient geriatric clinic, composed of a pharmacist, social worker, and physician collaborated with three SNFs to develop a protocol to improve continuity of care for returning clinic patients. Information from the recent hospitalization and SNF stay included: discharge medication lists/summaries and medication administration records. Within 3 business days of discharge, a pharmacist and pharmacy student contacted patients or family representatives via telephone to identify drug therapy problems, perform medication reconciliation, and update the electronic medical record (EMR). Referrals were made to the social worker if necessary. Therapeutic recommendations were documented in the EMR and communicated to the interprofessional team. RESULTS: The pharmacy team contacted 10 patients, of which 8 had > 10 medications. All 10 patients (100%) were found to have medication related problems, with the most frequent problems being unnecessary drug therapy (50%) and adherence issues (50%). The pharmacist identified 26 medication-related problems (mean 2.6 per patient), made 17 recommendations and provided 22 counseling points. Common co-morbidities included: hypertension (70%), osteoporosis (50%), and pain (30%). Only 1 patient required hospitalization within 30 days after the encounter which was due to an infectious process unrelated to the previous admission. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists have a crucial role as part of an interprofessional team to identify and reduce the number of medication related problems in geriatric patients during transitions of care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Providing specialized patient care to patients with no insurance can enable them to better manage their medications, experience optimal outcomes, and ensure more effective use of health care services. This study measured improvement in low-income diabetic patient outcomes through participating in a MTM program. METHODS: Patients comprised of residents participating in the CareNet program, in Lucas County, OH which provides coordinated health care for low-income residents. Patients received MTM services from their pharmacists on a quarterly basis. Patients were provided diabetic supplies, such as lancets and test strips, at no cost to encourage participation. The study used a prospective pre-post design following patients for a year. Clinical [HbA1c level, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)] humanistic (patient satisfaction, adherence, knowledge surveys and quality of life) and social (caffeine and alcohol consumption, smoking, exercise) outcomes were measured at staggered intervals. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were enrolled. Clinical measures. Mean HbA1c concentration decreased from baseline to the three-month follow-up. Patients who had an HbA1c level greater than 7% at baseline saw a decrease of 0.5% from baseline to three months. Mean SBP and DBP values decreased significantly from baseline. Patients with a baseline SBP > 140 mmHg experienced a significant change in BP at 3 months (-16 mmHg). Patients with a baseline DBP of greater than 90 mmHg experienced a significant decrease of 16.00 mmHg from baseline. Humanistic measures. Patient knowledge increased for all disease states and overall patient satisfaction increased significantly. Social measures. There was a decrease in caffeine and alcohol consumption, a significant decrease in smoking, and increase in exercise. Nine month results for all outcomes will be presented. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists can improve quality of care, access to care and positive outcomes for low-income patients in a relatively short amount of time.

TI  - A medication therapy management program (MTMP) in an integrated healthcare delivery system kaiser permanente georgia region

AB  - Purpose:To describe use of innovation and technology within an integrated healthcare delivery system for the MTMP. Description: The Kaiser Permanente Georgia (KPGA) MTMP identifies and invites patients that are likely to incur annual drug costs greater than or equal to $4000; are taking at least 5 chronic or maintenance medications covered by Medicare Part D; and have at least 2 of the 5 following chronic conditions: asthma, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Participation is voluntary. Participants are tracked in a robust electronic database- Permanente Online Interactive Network Tools (POINT). POINT data includes claims, hospitalization, pharmacy, laboratory, physical exam, last/next provider dates, hospitalization risk calculators, chronic kidney disease staging, cancer screening metrics, naïve status of certain medications, co-payment information and last verified smoking status. KP GA uses an electronic medical record (EMR), allowing the MTM clinical pharmacists broader involvement in overall care of the patient. The clinical pharmacists perform an initial assessment to validate the complete medication profile and evaluate/address: patient adherence, drug therapy duplication, potential drug interactions, lab monitoring, potential cost-effective alternatives and drug therapy appropriateness. Working in collaboration with the patient's primary care physician (PCP), the clinical pharmacists develop and implement individualized plans with the use of therapeutic protocols. Patients are reevaluated at least quarterly via telephone or free in-person office visit with the pharmacist. Therapeutic recommendations are documented in the EMR using a template to ensure that documentation is consistent among pharmacists. Currently, 330 out of 750 eligible members are enrolled in the KPGA MTMP.The number of covered Part D 30 day equivalent prescriptions PMPM (per member/per month) is 7.81 compared to the overall Medicare population which is 2.52. The drug cost PMPM of Part D covered medications is $592.60 compared to the overall Medicare population (inclusive of MTM members) at $52.81. These data are not surprising, as members selected for the program have more chronic conditions and require more medications. Because the program directly helps the PCP address chronic conditions, it adds value to overall quality of care.
