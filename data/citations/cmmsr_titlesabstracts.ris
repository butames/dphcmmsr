AB  - BACKGROUND: The Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) Plan Quality and Performance Program, or Star Ratings Program, allows Medicare beneficiaries to  compare quality of care among available Medicare Advantage prescription drug  (MA-PD) plans and stand-alone prescription drug plans (PDPs). Health plans have  increased intervention efforts and applied existing care management  infrastructure as an approach to improving member medication adherence and  subsequent Part D star rating performance. Independent Care Health Plan (iCare),  an MA-PD plan; MedImpact Healthcare Systems, Inc. (MedImpact), a pharmacy  benefits manager; and US MED, a mail order pharmacy, partnered to engage and  enroll iCare's dual-eligible special needs population in an intervention designed  to improve patient medication adherence and health plan performance for 3 Part D  patient safety outcome measures: Medication Adherence for Oral Diabetes  Medications (ODM), Medication Adherence for Hypertension (HTN), and Medication  Adherence for Cholesterol (CHOL). OBJECTIVES: To (a) assess the effectiveness of  a coordinated member-directed medication adherence intervention and (b) determine  the overall impact of the intervention on adherence rates and CMS Part D star  rating adherence measures.  METHODS: Administrative pharmacy claims and health  plan eligibility data from MedImpact's databases were used to identify members  using 3 target medication classes. Adherence was estimated by the proportion of  days covered (PDC) for all members. Those members considered at high risk for  nonadherence were prioritized for care management services. Risk factors were  based on members' use of more than 1 target medication class, newly started  therapy, and suboptimal adherence (PDC  less than  80%) in the most recent  6-month period. Data files listing member adherence rates and contact information  were formatted and loaded monthly into iCare's care management system, which  triggered an alert for care coordinators to counsel members on the importance of  adherence and offer the members an option for monthly 30-day supply medication  delivery via US MED. Member adherence rates were calculated 9 months pre- and  postimplementation for all members and adjusted by length of member enrollment  based on CMS technical specifications. Regression analysis assessed pre-post  changes in rates comparing 2 intervention groups: (1) members receiving iCare  counseling only (iCare-only) and (2) members receiving counseling and medication  delivery (iCare + US MED). To evaluate the overall impact of the intervention,  iCare's adherence rates and iCare's measure-specific star ratings for the 2011  and 2012 calendar years (CMS measurement years) were compared with the national  MA-PD plan contract average and with a health plan similar in member  characteristics but without adherence intervention exposure.  RESULTS: A total of  2,700 members were initially targeted for referral to iCare care management and  US MED customer service specialist teams. Between April 2012 (implementation  date) and January 2013, 1,302 (48.2%) members enrolled in the US MED component of  the intervention. Seventy-six percent of identified members were nonadherent  (PDC  less than  80%) to 1 of the 3 target medication classes, and 32% of members  were nonadherent to more than 1 target medication class. Pre-post absolute  average adherence rates increased for the iCare-only group (ODM = 15.1,  HTN = 10.1, CHOL = 13.6) and the iCare-US MED group (ODM = 30.9, HTN = 25.5,  CHOL = 29.4).  From 2011 to 2012, iCare adherence rates increased by absolute  differences of 15.2, 9.2, and 10.1 percentage points for ODM, HTN, and CHOL  measures, respectively, compared with the average MA-PD plan contract differences  (1.1, 2.1, and 2.5) and the comparator health plan differences (-2.7, -1.4, and  -4.1). Increases in iCare's adherence rates were associated with significant  increases in iCare's 2014 adherence measure star ratings (1 star to 3 stars for  ODM and CHOL, 1 star to 2 stars for HTN), which contributed to increases in the  Drug Plan Quality Improvement measure (2 stars to 4 stars) and iCare's overall  Part D star rating (3 to 3.5 stars).  CONCLUSIONS: Members in this MA-PD plan  dual-eligible population benefited from multiple points of contact to achieve  increased adherence. Health plans can use network pharmacies, care management  staff, and their pharmacy benefits managers to collaborate and implement  interventions aimed to improve members' adherence to targeted maintenance  medications and overall health plan quality performance and star ratings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medications are an integral component of management for many chronic conditions, and suboptimal adherence limits medication effectiveness among  persons with multiple chronic conditions (MCC). Medical homes may provide a  mechanism for increasing adherence among persons with MCC, thereby enhancing  management of chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between  medical home enrollment and adherence to newly initiated medications among  Medicaid enrollees with MCC. RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study  comparing Community Care of North Carolina medical home enrollees to nonenrollees  using merged North Carolina Medicaid claims data (fiscal years 2008-2010).  SUBJECTS: Among North Carolina Medicaid-enrolled adults with MCC, we created  separate longitudinal cohorts of new users of antidepressants (N=9303),  antihypertensive agents (N=12,595), oral diabetic agents (N=6409), and statins  (N=9263). MEASURES: Outcomes were the proportion of days covered (PDC) on  treatment medication each month for 12 months and a dichotomous measure of  adherence (PDC>0.80). Our primary analysis utilized person-level fixed effects  models. Sensitivity analyses included propensity score and person-level  random-effect models. RESULTS: Compared with nonenrollees, medical home enrollees  exhibited higher PDC by 4.7, 6.0, 4.8, and 5.1 percentage points for depression,  hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, respectively (P's<0.001). The  dichotomous adherence measure showed similar increases, with absolute differences  of 4.1, 4.5, 3.5, and 4.6 percentage points, respectively (P's<0.001).  CONCLUSIONS: Among Medicaid enrollees with MCC, adherence to new medications is  greater for those enrolled in medical homes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality in the United States, representing the highest total expenditures among major diseases.  To improve CVD-associated outcomes, medication therapy management (MTM) services  have been included in essential health benefit packages offered by various health  plans. Nevertheless, the impact of such MTM services on outcomes is still  unclear, especially from the perspective of the self-insured employer.   OBJECTIVES: To (a) compare economic outcomes between patients who received and  those who did not receive MTM services from the self-insured employer's  perspective and (b) compare clinical outcomes before and after receiving MTM  services.  METHODS: This study consisted of 2 pre- and post-retrospective  designs: (1) a cohort study with comparison groups and (2) a cohort study within  group comparison. Patients were beneficiaries aged 19 years or older who were  diagnosed with CVD conditions according to ICD-9-CM codes and continuously  enrolled in a public university-sponsored insurance plan between 2008-2010.  Patients were divided into MTM and non-MTM groups. The first MTM encounter was  assigned as the index date for the MTM group. Match-paired patients who did not  receive MTM services were randomly assigned the index date based on age category,  gender, and comorbidity. Measures for pharmacy, medical, and total expenditures  were obtained from medical and pharmacy claims. Paired t-tests and independent  t-tests using data generated from 1000 bootstraps compared mean cost difference  within and between groups. The return on investment (ROI) was calculated by  dividing the average net benefit from MTM services by the average cost of MTM  services. Clinical parameters, including blood pressure (BP) and body mass index  (BMI), were retrieved from electronic medical records from a pharmacist-provided  clinic where MTM services took place. Paired-t tests were used to compare the  mean difference between baseline and endpoint values. Further, this study  examined changes in the proportion of patients who achieved an individualized  treatment goal for BP and BMI. The study also quantified the improvement in  disease stages after the index date using the McNemar's test. Statistical  analyses were performed by using SAS software version 9.2 with statistical  significance level of 0.05.   RESULTS: A total of 63 patients and 62 match-paired  patients were included in the MTM group and the non-MTM group, respectively. The  mean cost (SD) per patient in the MTM group during the 6 months post-index period  for CVD-related pharmacy, all-cause medical, and total expenditures was lower  than the 6 months pre-index period by $22.0 (19.1), $79.2 (99.6), and $75.1  (136.2), respectively. In contrast, the mean cost (SD) for the non-MTM group  increased during the 6 months post-index date by $10.7 (24.2), $246.4 (248.4),  and $289.0 (269.5) for pharmacy, medical, and total  expenditure, respectively.  When comparing the 2 groups, the MTM group had statistically significantly lower  costs per patient for pharmacy expenditures (difference of -31.9 ± 25.1, P  less  than  0.0001), medical expenditures (difference of -$325.6 ± 271.2, P  less than  0.0001), and total direct expenditures (difference of -$359.3 ± 219.2, P  less  than  0.0001). Given the net benefit of MTM services ($359.3) and the average  cost of MTM service ($134.6), the ROI was $1.67 per $1 in MTM cost. Regarding  clinical outcomes, while no statistically significant differences were observed  in clinical outcomes, MTM services demonstrated clinical benefits. At the  post-index period, the percentage of patients who had achieved their goals  increased from 55% to 70% for BP and from 13.0% to 21.7% for normal BMI compared  with the pre-index period. In terms of the extent of improvement in disease  stages, clinical improvements in the stages of hypertension (χ2 =12.77, P  less  than  0.05) as well as BMI (χ2 =6.39, P  less than  0.05) at the endpoint were  observed.  CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular-related pharmacy, all-cause medical, and  total expenditures were statistically lower among beneficiaries who received MTM  services compared with those who did not. In addition, MTM services had a  positive ROI and demonstrated clinical significances by the increasing number of  patients who achieved treatment goals and improved disease stages for  hypertension and BMI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and sustainability of a 6-month Team Education and Adherence Monitoring (TEAM) intervention for black patients with  hypertension in community chain pharmacies. DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial.  SETTING: 28 chain pharmacies (14 TEAM and 14 control) in five Wisconsin cities  from December 2006 to February 2009. PARTICIPANTS: 576 black patients with  hypertension. INTERVENTION: Trained pharmacist-technician teams implemented a  6-month intervention using scheduled visits, Brief Medication Questionnaires  (BMQs), and novel toolkits for facilitating medication adherence and pharmacist  feedback to patients and physicians. Control participants received patient  information only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Refill adherence (≥80% days covered) and  changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and blood  pressure control using blinded assessments at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: At  baseline, all patients had blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more. Of those  eligible, 79% activated the intervention (mean 4.25 visits). Compared with  control participants at 6 months, TEAM participants achieved greater improvements  in refill adherence (60% vs. 34%, P < 0.001), SBP (-12.62 vs. -5.31 mm Hg, P <  0.001), and blood pressure control (50% vs. 36%, P = 0.01). Six months after  intervention discontinuation, TEAM participants showed sustained improvements in  refill adherence ( P < 0.001) and SBP ( P = 0.004), though the difference in  blood pressure control was not significant ( P < 0.05) compared with control  participants. Analysis of intervention fidelity showed that patients who received  the full intervention during months 1 through 6 achieved significantly greater 6-  and 12-month improvements in refill adherence and blood pressure control compared  with control participants. CONCLUSION: A team-based intervention involving  community chain pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and novel toolkits led to  significant and sustained improvements in refill adherence and SBP in black  patients with hypertension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several observational studies have evaluated the effect of a single exposure window with blood pressure (BP) medications on outcomes in incident  dialysis patients, but whether BP medication prescription patterns remain stable  or a single exposure window design is adequate to evaluate effect on outcomes is  unclear. METHODS: We described patterns of BP medication prescription over 6  months after dialysis initiation in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis  patients, stratified by cardiovascular comorbidity, diabetes, and other patient  characteristics. The cohort included 13,072 adult patients (12,159 hemodialysis,  913 peritoneal dialysis) who initiated dialysis in Dialysis Clinic, Inc.,  facilities January 1, 2003-June 30, 2008, and remained on the original modality  for at least 6 months. We evaluated monthly patterns in BP medication  prescription over 6 months and at 12 and 24 months after initiation. RESULTS:  Prescription patterns varied by dialysis modality over the first 6 months;  substantial proportions of patients with prescriptions for beta-blockers, renin  angiotensin system agents, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in month  6 no longer had prescriptions for these medications by month 24. Prescription of  specific medication classes varied by comorbidity, race/ethnicity, and age, but  little by sex. The mean number of medications was 2.5 at month 6 in hemodialysis  and peritoneal dialysis cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates BP medication  patterns in both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients over the first 6  months of dialysis. Our findings highlight the challenges of assessing  comparative effectiveness of a single BP medication class in dialysis patients.  Longitudinal designs should be used to account for changes in BP medication  management over time, and designs that incorporate common combinations should be  considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication adherence, defined as taking medications as prescribed, is a key component in controlling disease progression and managing chronic illnesses  such as diabetes, hypertension, and high blood cholesterol. These diseases  constitute 3 of the top 5 most prevalent conditions among Medicare beneficiaries,  warranting further attention to find ways to promote better medication adherence.  The scientific literature has established the clinical and financial benefits of  medication adherence and the role of dispensing channel in impacting adherence to  medications. However, a common limitation in channel-adherence studies is the  failure to control for healthy adherer effect (HAE), referring to individuals who  are likely to engage proactively in activities that improve their adherence.  Healthier individuals may choose the home-delivery channel to ensure continuity  in their medication regimens and to minimize obstacles to adherence, such as  inadequate access, inconvenience, and financial concerns. Thus, better medication  adherence in home delivery may reflect healthier patients' predisposition to  self-select for home delivery options. To accurately attribute the impact of  dispensing channel on adherence, research would need to control for bias from a  patient's predisposition to be adherent.  OBJECTIVE: To examine the association  of pharmacy dispensing channel (home delivery or retail pharmacy) with medication  adherence for Medicare Part D beneficiaries taking medications for diabetes,  hypertension, or high blood cholesterol, while controlling for low-income subsidy  status, differences in days supply, and prior adherence behavior (PAB) as a way  to partly control for HAE. METHODS: A retrospective analysis using de-identified  pharmacy claims data from a large national pharmacy benefits manager between  October 2010 and December 2012. Continuously eligible Medicare Part D  beneficiaries (Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans participants only)  aged 65 years or older who had an antidiabetic, antihypertensive, or  antihyperlipidemic prescription claim between October and December 2010, were  identified and followed for the next 2 years. Those enrolled in a home delivery  auto refill program were excluded from this analysis. Multivariate logistic  regression was used to evaluate the impact of dispensing channel on medication  adherence, controlling for differences in demographics, low-income subsidy  status, disease burden, and drug-use pattern. Patients with a proportion of days  covered of ≥ 80% were considered to be adherent. The analysis controlled for PAB  by using patients' adherence status in the year 2011.  RESULTS: The final  analytical samples consisted of 150,389 diabetic patients, 615,618 hypertension  patients, and 358,795 high blood cholesterol patients. The adjusted odds of being  adherent for beneficiaries using home delivery were 1.25 times higher  (CI = 1.20-1.30) for diabetes medications, 1.29 times higher (CI = 1.27-1.32) for  hypertension medications, and 1.26 times higher (CI = 1.23-1.29) for high blood  cholesterol medications, compared with beneficiaries using retail channels to  obtain their prescriptions. PAB was the strongest contributor to the odds of a  patient being adherent across all 3 therapy classes, ranging from odds ratio of  4.48 to 8.09.  CONCLUSIONS: After excluding patients who received any  prescriptions via home delivery auto refill programs and controlling for PAB,  differences in days supply, low-income subsidy status, demographics, and disease  burden, Medicare beneficiaries who use home delivery for antidiabetics,  antihypertensives, or antihyperlipidemics have a greater likelihood of being  adherent than patients who fill their prescriptions at retail. The results of  this study provide evidence that where medications are received may impact  adherence, even when controlling for PAB. Use of the home delivery dispensing  channel may be an effective method to improve adherence for Medicare  beneficiaries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the most important and often overlooked challenges for accountable care organizations (ACOs) is ensuring the optimal use of  pharmaceuticals, which can be accomplished by utilizing pharmacists' skillsets  and leveraging their full clinical expertise. Developing capabilities that  support, monitor, and ensure appropriate medication use, efficacy, and safety is  critical to achieving optimal patient outcomes and, ultimately, to an ACO's  success. The program described in this article highlights the best practices of  Fairview Pharmacy Services' Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program with  additional thoughts and considerations on this and similar MTM programs provided  by The Working Group on Optimizing Medication Therapy in Value-Based Healthcare.  PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Fairview Pharmacy Services utilizes 23 MTM pharmacists  (approximately 18 full-time equivalents) working in 30 locations, who conduct  pharmacotherapy workups as part of the MTM services that Fairview provides.  Pharmacists focus on patients in a comprehensive manner and assess all of their  diseases and medications. Responsibilities include (a) identification of a  patient's drug-related needs with a commitment to meet those needs; (b) an  assessment and confirmation that all of a patient's drug therapy is appropriately  indicated, effective and safe, and that the patient is compliant; (c) achievement  of therapy outcomes and ensuring documentation of those outcomes; and (d)  collaboration with all members of a patient's care team. OBSERVATIONS: Since  1998, pharmacists have cared for more than 20,000 patients and resolved more than  107,000 medication-related problems which, if left unresolved, could have led to  hospital readmissions and emergency visits. Since becoming a Pioneer ACO,  Fairview pharmacists have focused on the highest-risk members and have seen over  670 ACO patients, resolving over 2,780 medication-related problems. In terms of  clinical outcomes, MTM contributed to optimal care in complex patients with  diabetes. A review of 2007 data found that the percentage of diabetes patients  optimally managed (as measured by a composite of hemoglobin A1c, low-density  lipoprotein, blood pressure, aspirin use, and no smoking) was significantly  higher for MTM patients (21% vs. 45%, P < 0.01). The Fairview MTM also showed a  12:1 return on investment (ROI) when comparing the overall health care costs of  patients receiving MTM services with patients who did not receive those services.  IMPLICATIONS: Developing an MTM program to manage and optimize pharmaceuticals  will be a cornerstone to managing the health of a population. Important lessons  have been learned that may be helpful to other health systems developing MTM  programs. In an accountable care environment measuring the return on the  investment of all care interventions, including MTM will be essential to maintain  the program. The ACO will also have to be able to correctly identify which  patients are candidates for MTM services and provide pharmacists with enough  autonomy, including scheduling face-to-face interactions with patients and the  ability to change prescriptions if necessary, to ensure that timely and effective  care is delivered. In order for an ACO to deliver high quality patient-centered  medication services, there must be clear lines of communication between  providers, pharmacists, and the other care providers within the organization.  Finally, a strong and visionary leader is critical to ensuring the success of an  MTM program and ultimately the ACO itself. RECOMMENDATIONS: While there is a  plethora of literature touting the benefits of either in-person or  telephonic-based MTM, there is little research to date that directly compares  these 2 MTM delivery types. It is critical for research to address the direct and  indirect costs associated with starting and maintaining an MTM program.  Information such as technologies required to start a program and length of time  until a program breaks even or meets a sufficient ROI can be helpful for health  care providers in similar health systems pitching a similar type of program.  Finally, there has yet to be significant empirical research into the cost savings  of utilizing a pharmacist and MTM services associated with meeting quality and  cost benchmarks in an accountable care payment arrangement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Only half of hypertensive adults achieve blood pressure (BP) control in the United States, and it is unclear how BP control rates may be improved most  effectively and efficiently at the population level. OBJECTIVE: We sought to  compare the potential effects of system-wide isolated improvements in medication  adherence, visit frequency, and higher physician prescription rate on achieving  BP control at 52 weeks. DESIGN: We developed a Markov microsimulation model of  patient-level, physician-level, and system-level processes involved in  controlling hypertension with medications. The model is informed by data from  national surveys, cohort studies and trials, and was validated against two  multicenter clinical trials (ALLHAT and VALUE). SUBJECTS: We studied a simulated,  nationally representative cohort of patients with diagnosed but uncontrolled  hypertension with a usual source of care. INTERVENTIONS: We simulated a base case  and improvements of 10 and 50%, and an ideal scenario for three modifiable  parameters: visit frequency, treatment intensification, and medication adherence.  Ideal scenarios were defined as 100% for treatment intensification and adherence,  and return visits occurring within 4 weeks of an elevated office systolic BP.  MAIN OUTCOME: BP control at 52 weeks of follow-up was examined. RESULTS: Among  25,000 hypothetical adult patients with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP ≥  140 mmHg), only 18% achieved BP control after 52 weeks using base-case  assumptions. With 10/50%/idealized enhancements in each isolated parameter,  enhanced treatment intensification achieved the greatest BP control (19/23/71%),  compared with enhanced visit frequency (19/21/35%) and medication adherence  (19/23/26%). When all three processes were idealized, the model predicted a BP  control rate of 95% at 52 weeks. CONCLUSION: Substantial improvements in BP  control can only be achieved through major improvements in processes of care.  Healthcare systems may achieve greater success by increasing the frequency of  clinical encounters and improving physicians' prescribing behavior than by  attempting to improve patient adherence to medications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary care providers do not routinely follow guidelines for the care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Multidisciplinary efforts may  improve care for patients with chronic disease. Pharmacist based interventions  have effectively improved management of hypertension. We performed a pragmatic,  randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a pharmacist based quality  improvement program on 1) outcomes for patients with CKD and 2) adherence to CKD  guidelines in the primary care setting. METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe  CKD receiving primary care services at one of thirteen community-based Veterans  Affairs outpatient clinics were randomized to a multifactorial intervention that  included a phone-based pharmacist intervention, pharmacist-physician  collaboration, patient education, and a CKD registry (n = 1070) or usual care  (n = 1129). The primary process outcome was measurement of parathyroid hormone  (PTH) during the one year study period. The primary clinical outcome was blood  pressure (BP) control in subjects with poorly controlled hypertension at  baseline. RESULTS: Among those with poorly controlled baseline BP, there was no  difference in the last recorded BP or the percent at goal BP during the study  period (42.0% vs. 41.2% in the control arm). Subjects in the intervention arm  were more likely to have a PTH measured during the study period (46.9% vs. 16.1%  in the control arm, P <0.001) and were on more classes of antihypertensive  medications at the end of the study (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: A one-time  pharmacist based intervention proved feasible in patients with CKD. While the  intervention did not improve BP control, it did improve guideline adherence and  increased the number of antihypertensive medications prescribed to subjects with  poorly controlled BP. These findings can inform the design of quality improvement  programs and future studies which are needed to improve care of patients with  CKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01290614.

AB  - The objective of this study was to describe medication adherence and medication intensification in a physician-pharmacist collaborative management (PPCM) model  compared with usual care. This study was a prospective, cluster, randomized study  in 32 primary care offices from 15 states. The primary outcomes were medication  adherence and anti-hypertensive medication changes during the first 9 months of  the intervention. The 9-month visit was completed by 539 patients, 345 of which  received the intervention. There was no significant difference between  intervention and usual care patients in regards to medication adherence at  9 months. Intervention patients received significantly more medication changes  (4.9 vs.1.1; P = .0003) and had significantly increased use of diuretics and  aldosterone antagonists when compared with usual care (P = .01).The PPCM model  increased medication intensification; however, no significant change in  medication adherence was detected. PPCM models will need to develop non-adherence  identification and intervention methods to further improve the potency of the  care team.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes (glycosylated hemoglobin [A1C], blood pressure, and lipids) and other measurements (disease state knowledge, adherence,  and self-efficacy) associated with the use of approved telemonitoring devices to  expand and improve chronic disease management of patients with diabetes, with or  without hypertension. SETTING: Four community health centers (CHCs) in Utah.  PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Federally qualified safety net clinics that provide medical  care to underserved patients. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Pharmacist-led diabetes  management using telemonitoring was compared with a group of patients receiving  usual care (without telemonitoring). INTERVENTIONS: Daily blood glucose (BG) and  blood pressure (BP) values were reviewed and the pharmacist provided phone  follow-up to assess and manage out-of-range BG and BP values. EVALUATION: Changes  in A1C, BP, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) at approximately 6 months were  compared between the telemonitoring group and the usual care group. Patient  activation, diabetes/hypertension knowledge, and medication adherence were  measured in the telemonitoring group. RESULTS: Of 150 patients, 75 received  pharmacist-provided diabetes management and education via telemonitoring, and 75  received usual medical care. Change in A1C was significantly greater in the  telemonitoring group compared with the usual care group (2.07% decrease vs. 0.66%  decrease; P <0.001). Although BP and LDL levels also declined, differences  between the two groups were not statistically significant. Patient activation  measure, diabetes/hypertension knowledge, and medication adherence with  antihypertensives (but not diabetes medications) improved in the telemonitoring  group. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-provided diabetes management via telemonitoring  resulted in a significant improvement in A1C in federally qualified CHCs in Utah  compared with usual medical care. Telemonitoring may be considered a model for  providing clinical pharmacy services to patients with diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary open angle glaucoma is a chronic, progressive eye disease that is the leading cause of blindness among African Americans. Glaucoma  progresses more rapidly and appears about 10 years earlier in African Americans  as compared to whites. African Americans are also less likely to receive  comprehensive eye care when glaucoma could be detected before irreversible  blindness. Screening and follow-up protocols for managing glaucoma recommended by  eye-care professional organizations are often not followed by primary eye-care  providers, both ophthalmologists and optometrists. There is a pressing need to  improve both the accessibility and quality of glaucoma care for African  Americans. Telemedicine may be an effective solution for improving management and  diagnosis of glaucoma because it depends on ocular imaging and tests that can be  electronically transmitted to remote reading centers where tertiary care  specialists can examine the results. We describe the Eye Care Quality and  Accessibility Improvement in the Community project (EQUALITY), set to evaluate a  teleglaucoma program deployed in retail-based primary eye care practices serving  communities with a large percentage of African Americans. METHODS/DESIGN: We  conducted an observational, 1-year prospective study based in two Walmart Vision  Centers in Alabama staffed by primary care optometrists. EQUALITY focuses on new  or existing adult patients who are at-risk for glaucoma or already diagnosed with  glaucoma. Patients receive dilated comprehensive examinations and diagnostic  testing for glaucoma, followed by the optometrist's diagnosis and a preliminary  management plan. Results are transmitted to a glaucoma reading center where  ophthalmologists who completed fellowship training in glaucoma review results and  provide feedback to the optometrist, who manages the care of the patient.  Patients also receive eye health education about glaucoma and comprehensive eye  care. Research questions include diagnostic and management agreement between  providers, the impact of eye health education on patients' knowledge and  adherence to follow-up and medication, patient satisfaction, program  cost-effectiveness, and EQUALITY's impact on Walmart pharmacy prescription rates.  DISCUSSION: As eye-care delivery systems in the US strive to improve quality  while reducing costs, telemedicine programs including teleglaucoma initiatives  such as EQUALITY could contribute toward reaching this goal, particularly among  underserved populations at-risk for chronic blinding diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between medical costs and persistence with beta blockers among hypertensive patients, and to quantify persistence related  medical cost differences with nebivolol, which is associated with improved  tolerability, versus other beta blockers. METHODS: Adults who initiated  hypertension treatment with a beta blocker were identified from the MarketScan *  claims database (2008-2012). Patients were classified based on their first beta  blocker use: nebivolol, atenolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and other beta  blockers. Patients with compelling indications for atenolol, carvedilol or  metoprolol (acute coronary syndrome and congestive heart failure) were excluded.  Patients enrolled in health maintenance organization or capitated point of  service insurance plans were also excluded. Persistence was defined as continuous  use of the index drug (<60 day gap). The average effect of persistence on medical  costs (2012 USD) was estimated using generalized linear models (GLMs). Regression  estimates were used to predict medical cost differences associated with  persistence between nebivolol and the other cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 587,424  hypertensive patients met the inclusion criteria. Each additional month of  persistence with any one beta blocker was associated with $152.51 in all-cause  medical cost savings; continuous treatment for 1 year was associated with  $1585.98 in all-cause medical cost savings. Patients treated with nebivolol had  longer persistence during the 1 year study period (median: 315 days) than all  other beta blockers (median: 156-292 days). Longer persistence with nebivolol  translated into $305.74 all-cause medical cost savings relative to all other beta  blockers. LIMITATIONS: The results may not be generalizable to hypertensive  patients with acute coronary syndrome or congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS:  Longer persistence with beta blockers for the treatment of hypertension was  associated with lower medical costs. There may be greater cost savings due to  better persistence with nebivolol than other beta blockers.

AB  - In the U.S., more than 400,000 individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) require hemodialysis (HD) for renal replacement therapy. ESRD patients experience  a high burden of morbidity, mortality, resource utilization, and poor quality of  life (QOL). Under current care models, ESRD patients receive fragmented care from  multiple providers at multiple locations. The Patient-Centered Medical Home  (PCMH) is a team approach, providing coordinated care across the healthcare  continuum. While this model has shown some early benefits for complex chronic  diseases such as diabetes, it has not been applied to HD patients. This study is  a non-randomized quasi-experimental intervention trial implementing a  Patient-Centered Medical Home for Kidney Disease (PCMH-KD). The PCMH-KD extends  the existing dialysis care team (comprised of a nephrologist, dialysis nurse,  dialysis technician, social worker, and dietitian) by adding a general internist,  pharmacist, nurse coordinator, and a community health worker, all of whom will  see the patients together, and separately, as needed. The primary goal is to  implement a comprehensive, multidisciplinary care team to improve care  coordination, quality of life, and healthcare use for HD patients. Approximately  240 patients will be recruited from two sites; a non-profit university-affiliated  dialysis center and an independent for-profit dialysis center. Outcomes include  (i) patient-reported outcomes, including QOL and satisfaction; (ii) clinical  outcomes, including blood pressure and diet; (iii) healthcare use, including  emergency room visits and hospitalizations; and (iv) staff perceptions. Given the  significant burden that patients with ESRD on HD experience, enhanced care  coordination provides an opportunity to reduce this burden and improve QOL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor blood pressure (BP) control is a primary risk factor for target organ damage in the heart, brain, and kidney. Uncontrolled hypertension is common  among emergency department (ED) patients, particularly in underresourced  settings, but it is unclear what role ED providers should play in the management  of chronic antihypertensive therapy. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to evaluate  the safety and efficacy of prescribing antihypertensive therapy from the ED.  METHODS: This was a retrospective study of data pooled from two prospective,  longitudinal, randomized controlled trials, both of which enrolled ED patients  with asymptomatic hypertension. Antihypertensives were prescribed at emergency  physician discretion, and this was not related to randomization arm. Demographic  data, BP at screening and randomization visit, and data on adverse effects  potentially related to antihypertensive therapy were compiled. Means were  compared using Student's t-tests, and proportions were compared using chi-square  tests. The effect of antihypertensive therapy on BP control was further analyzed  using multivariable regression modeling controlling for age, race, sex,  hypertension history, study cohort, and ED BP. RESULTS: Data were abstracted for  217 subjects. The median interval from ED visit to randomization was 12 days.  Seventy-six subjects (35%) received one or more prescriptions for  antihypertensive therapy. Age, sex, race, hypertension history, and mean duration  of hypertension were equivalent between groups. Although mean ED BP was higher  among those who received prescriptions, the mean systolic BP (sBP) reduction from  ED to randomization was significantly greater (difference = 19 mm Hg, 95%  confidence interval = 12 to 26 mm Hg). No patient in either group had an sBP less  than 100 mm Hg at randomization. On multiple regression modeling, randomization  sBP reduction was independently associated with antihypertensive prescription  (p = 0.001). The incidence of adverse effects was equivalent and low in both  groups. No new neurological deficits, ischemic events, or life-threatening  anaphylactic reactions were reported in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription  of antihypertensive medication from the ED is associated with significantly lower  sBP at short-term outpatient follow-up. Antihypertensive therapy was not  associated with an increased incidence of adverse events, and BP reduction did  not exceed potentially harmful levels. Initiation of chronic antihypertensive  therapy in the ED is safe and effective and may be a reasonable consideration for  at-risk populations.

AB  - Physician-pharmacist collaborative care (PPCC) is effective in improving blood pressure (BP) control, but primary care provider (PCP) engagement in such models  has not been well-studied. The authors analyzed data from PPCC referrals to 108  PCPs, for patients with uncontrolled hypertension, assessing the proportion of  referral requests approved, disapproved, and not responded to, and reasons for  disapproval. Of 2232 persons with uncontrolled hypertension, PPCC referral  requests were sent for 1516 (67.9%): 950 (62.7%) were approved, 406 (26.8%) were  disapproved, and 160 (10.6%) received no response. Approval rates differed widely  by PCP with a median approval rate of 75% (interquartile range, 41%-100%). The  most common reasons for disapproval were: PCP prefers to manage hypertension  (19%), and BP controlled per PCP (18%); 8% of cases were considered too complex  for PPCC. Provider acceptance of a PPCC hypertension clinic was generally high  and sustained but varied widely among PCPs. No single reason for disapproval  predominated.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Aggregate pharmacy claims available within an electronic health record (EHR) provide an opportunity to understand primary nonadherence in real  time. The objective of this study was to use pharmacy claims data available  within the EHR to identify the prevalence and predictors of primary nonadherence  to antihypertensive drug therapy in a multi-payer primary care network. STUDY  DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients prescribed a new  antihypertensive medication in a large primary care practice network between  January 2011 and September 2012. METHODS: We matched prescriptions for the new  antihypertensive to pharmacy claims listed in the EHR. The primary outcome was  the presence of a fill for the new medication within 30 days of the prescription.  RESULTS: Of 791 patients in our study cohort, two-thirds (522; 66%) filled their  prescription within 30 days. The majority (409; 78.4%) of that group filled the  prescription on the day it was issued. Lower diastolic blood pressure and  Medicare coverage increased the probability of nonadherence. CONCLUSIONS:  Medication fill data within the provider EHR can identify primary nonadherence in  clinical practice. As adoption of this technology increases, it provides an  opportunity to identify nonadherence, allowing for the effective design of  interventions to improve adherence to therapy.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Physician-pharmacist collaborative models have been shown to improve the care of patients with numerous chronic medical conditions. Team-based  health care using integrated clinical pharmacists provides one opportunity to  improve quality in health care systems that use population-based financing. In  November 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requested  that the relative value of pharmacists' work in team-based care needs to be  established. Thus the objective of this study was to describe the components of  pharmacists' work in the management of hypertension with a physician-pharmacist  collaborative model. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of the components of  pharmacists' work in the Collaboration Among Pharmacists and Physicians to  Improve Outcomes Now (CAPTION) study, a prospective, cluster randomized trial.  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: This analysis was intended to provide policymakers  with data and information, using the CAPTION study model, on the time and  intensity of pharmacists' work to understand pharmacists' relative value  contributions in the context of CMS financing and population management aims. The  CAPTION trial was conducted in 32 community-based medical offices in 15 U.S.  states and included 390 patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Blood  pressure was measured by trained study coordinators in each office, and patients  were included in the study if they had uncontrolled blood pressure. Included  patients were randomized to a 9-month intervention, a 24-month intervention, or  usual care. The goal of the pharmacist intervention was to improve blood pressure  control and resolve drug therapy problems impeding progress toward blood pressure  goals. This intervention included medical record review, a structured assessment  with the patient, collaboration to achieve goals of therapy, and patient  follow-up. The two intervention arms (9 and 24 mo) were identical the first 9  months, and that time frame is the focus of this workload evaluation. Pharmacists  completed study encounter forms for every patient encounter and estimated time  spent in pre-visit, face-to-face care, and post-visit activities. Among the 390  patients, there were 2811 encounters with pharmacists that involved 3.44  hours/patient for face-to-face care visits plus 1.55 hours/patient for pre-visit  and post-visit work. Intensity of work was reflected in interventions to resolve  drug therapy problems with patients (43% of encounters) and with physicians (1169  recommendations, of which physicians accepted 1153 [98.6%]), resulting in  improvement of patients' blood pressure goals achieved (from 0% at baseline to  43% at 9 months based on the primary study end point). CONCLUSION: Pharmacists  provided extensive interventions to patients with hypertension. This analysis  provides a framework for health systems, provider groups, and payers to measure  pharmacists' work in value-based financing and population management.

T2  - Pediatric cardiology
AB  - Many pharmacologic therapies are available for treatment of post-coarctectomy hypertension in pediatric patients, which may lead to variability in care.  Evaluation of trends in pharmacotherapy is necessary to evaluate quality of care.  The Pediatric Health Information System database was queried from 2004 to 2013  for patients >30 days of age who had an ICD-9 code for coarctation of the aorta  repair of coarctation by end-to-end anastomosis and had a RACHS-1 score of 2.  Patients were excluded if they were admitted for >30 days, underwent mechanical  circulatory support, or expired during the admission. Patient demographic and  hospital data were collected along with antihypertensive pharmacotherapy. Trends  in antihypertensive, analgesic, and sedative pharmacotherapy were evaluated, and  multivariable statistical analysis was used to determine variables that  significantly influenced cost. A total of 1636 patients [66.6 % male, median age  1.5 years (IQR 0.31-5.3)] met study criteria. Patients received a median of 3  (IQR 2-4) antihypertensive medications for a median of 8 days (IQR 5-11).  Intravenous antihypertensive therapy was prescribed for a median 3 days (IQR 2-5)  and oral therapy for a median of 1 day (IQR 1-2). Antihypertensive therapy was  continued at discharge in 79.8 % of patients. Hospital cost increased by 36 %  over the study period (p < 0.01), and nicardipine, dexmedetomidine, and  intravenous acetaminophen were most strongly associated with increased cost (p <  0.001). Variability in the pharmacotherapy of post-coarctectomy hypertension in  pediatric patients exists, and the use of newer agents may be influencing the  cost of care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide a review of the outcomes and costs in patients seen by Clinical Pharmacy Specialist (CPS) Certified Diabetes Educators in ambulatory  care for diabetes management. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review.  METHODS: All patients discharged by a CPS for diabetes management between January  1, 2010, and December 31, 2013, were included. RESULTS: A total of 915 patients  were discharged from CPS services. The majority of patients had type 2 diabetes  (98.7%) and were female (63.1%), Hispanic (53.3%), and on average, were aged 56  years. The patients were seen by the CPS for approximately 5.3 face-to-face  visits, and by their provider for 1.9 face-to-face visits. The average difference  from baseline for glycated hemoglobin was -2.6%, while the average systolic and  diastolic blood pressures improved by -8 mm Hg and -3 mm Hg, respectively. The  major lipid parameters also reported improvement, averaging -23 mg/dL for total  cholesterol, -54 mg/dL for triglycerides, -15 mg/dL for low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, -23 mg/dL for non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C),  and +0.8 mg/dL for HDL-C. Overall, the average difference from baseline to final  visit for the numbers and costs of medications and diabetes supplies per patient  increased slightly. Medication adherence also improved each year in patients with  diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The CPSs directly impact patient care through improvements  in clinical outcomes. They help patients achieve disease-state goals for  diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia through a variety of clinical  interventions and by promoting medication adherence. These data demonstrate the  significant positive impact to the institution that clinical pharmacy services  have in diabetes management.

AB  - Patient-centered, multidisciplinary interventions offer one of the most promising strategies to improve blood pressure (BP) control, yet effectiveness trials in  underserved real-world settings are limited. We used a multidisciplinary strategy  to improve hypertension control in an underserved urban practice. We collected  1007 surveys to monitor medication adherence and used weighted generalized  estimating equations to examine trends in BP control. We examined 13,404 visits  from patients with hypertension between August 2010 and February 2014. Overall,  BP control rates increased from 51.0% to 67.4% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; 95%  confidence interval, 1.44-1.74) by the end of the intervention phase and were  maintained during the postintervention phase (adjusted odds ratio, 1.60; 95%  confidence interval, 1.41-1.82). Medication adherence scores increased across the  intervention (5.9-6.6; P < .001), but were not sustained at the conclusion of the  study (5.9-6.2; P = .16). A multidisciplinary team approach involving registered  nurses, pharmacists, and physicians resulted in substantial improvements in  hypertension control in a real-world underserved setting.

T2  - Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent and ongoing developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) provide deeper insights into  pathogenic mechanisms. Approvals of new pharmacotherapies that improve function  and reduce morbidity and mortality risks; advances in clinical trial methods,  including long-term, event-driven studies with clinically relevant and  patient-centered endpoints; and trial results support a new therapeutic  management strategy. This new paradigm involves initial treatment with combined  therapies that act through different disease pathways. In addition, 2 new sets of  clinical practice guidelines for PAH have been published since June 2014. Despite  these advances, major gaps have been documented in the diagnosis, treatment, and  management of patients with PAH. OBJECTIVE: To present current knowledge and  evidence on PAH to support managed care professionals and providers in achieving  accurate differential diagnosis, promptly referring patients to specialists as  necessary, and ensuring that patients receive appropriate, guideline-directed  therapies. SUMMARY: Major gaps in the quality of care provided to patients with  PAH include oversights in clinicians' recognition of symptoms, delays in  diagnosis, and misdiagnosis ensuing from incomplete evaluations, delays in  referral of patients to centers of expertise and initiation of therapy, and  inappropriate treatment regimens. To address deficiencies in PAH diagnosis, new  practice guidelines emphasize the essential role of right heart catheterization  in characterizing and confirming the disease, as well as referral to expert  pulmonary hypertension centers to ensure appropriate evaluation and treatment.  Updated disease and functional classifications of PAH, along with new research  findings on prognostic factors and effects of comorbid conditions, offer key  support for making effective therapy and management decisions for patients with  PAH at different risk levels and stages of the disease. Since 2013, the U.S. Food  and Drug Administration has approved new PAH therapies in the classes of  endothelin receptor antagonists, guanylate cyclase stimulators, prostacyclin  analogues, and prostacyclin receptor agonists. As demonstrated through phase 3  clinical trials, these generally well-tolerated therapies delay disease  progression, improve hemodynamic and functional status, and decrease numbers of  hospitalizations. Moreover, 2 sets of recently published guidelines-developed by  the American College of Chest Physicians and the European Society of  Cardiology/European Respiratory Society-provide evidence-based and expert  consensus recommendations for achieving PAH treatment goals. The most recent  guidelines include a recommendation for upfront combination therapy for patients  with moderate disease, which is supported by new comparative clinical trial  evidence. As addressed in this article, these advances in the field of PAH have  important implications for managed care and clinical practice, including  considerations of cost-benefit outcomes associated with different management  strategies.

T2  - Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare Health Plan Quality and Performance Ratings program, or Star Ratings program, includes 3  medication adherence outcome measures (Medication Adherence for Diabetes  Medications, Medication Adherence for Hypertension, and Medication Adherence for  Cholesterol), which contribute to approximately 31% of a Medicare Advantage  prescription drug (MA-PD) plan's Part D summary rating and 12% of its overall  star rating (a weighted summary of a plan's Part C and Part D ratings). MA-PD  plans have been increasing their adherence intervention efforts as an approach to  improving beneficiaries' medication adherence and the plan's quality performance  ratings. However, few evaluations have examined the effects of these  interventions on medication adherence and performance ratings. OBJECTIVE: To  assess the impact of a quasi-experimental multichannel adherence intervention on  beneficiaries' medication adherence and health plan quality performance measures  for 2 MA-PD plans. The intervention included a daily prescriber-directed 90-day  retail refill component and a weekly member-directed refill reminder component.  METHODS: Members filling 1 or more medications assessed by the 3 CMS star ratings  adherence measures (oral antidiabetics [DM], antihypertensives [HTN], and statins  [CHOL]) were identified for a 2-component intervention starting in April 2013.  The retail-based 90-day refill component sent populated 90-day prescription  letters via fax to prescribers of members who had filled a 30-day prescription.  One fax per member-medication instance was sent and included the option to fax  approval of a new 90-day prescription. For prescribers who approved, members were  notified that a 90-day refill was available at their retail pharmacies. The  refill reminder component used weekly scans of pharmacy claims to identify  members' refill patterns. Reminder letters were sent to members 7 days late to  refill. An intent-to-treat approach was used to assess intervention  effectiveness. Pharmacy claims and health plan enrollment data were used to  calculate adherence among members enrolled 1 year pre- and postintervention start  (April 2013) for the intervention group and a comparator group that consisted of  4 MA-PD plans not implementing an adherence intervention. Adherence was estimated  by the proportion of days covered (PDC) and generalized linear models were fit to  calculate difference-in-difference (DID) estimators to control for demographics,  comorbidity, and changes in adherence over the study period. To estimate the  impact of the intervention on health plan quality performance, 2013 and 2014 CMS  star ratings for the respective 2012 and 2013 measurement years were compared by  group. RESULTS: During the first year of the intervention, 1,344 prescribers  representing 6,701 members were faxed 15,284 populated prescription letters.  Prescriber response rate was 53.7% and approval rate (approved letters of total  sent) was 47.3%. An average of 539 refill reminder letters were sent per week.  DID estimators showed positive influence of the intervention on adherence to HTN  and CHOL. For the intervention group, adherence increased 2.0 percentage points  (P < 0.001) for HTN and 1.8 percentage points (P < 0.001) for CHOL, relative to  the control group. The odds of achieving adherence (PDC ≥ 80%) were greater in  the intervention group compared with control for HTN (ratio of odds ratio [ROR] =  1.334; 95% CI = 1.203-1.479) and for CHOL (ROR = 1.247; 95% CI = 1.132-1.374).  For the 2 plans implementing the intervention, CMS-published adherence rates for  DM, HTN, and CHOL increased from 2012 to 2013 by an average 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0  percentage points, respectively, compared with the control group (3.5, 2.0, and  1.8 percentage points, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study found increases in  adherence to HTN and CHOL in 2 MA-PD plans implementing a combined prescriber and  patient-directed intervention. MA-PD plans can use broad multichannel  interventions to address common adherence barriers and as an approach to  improving members' adherence to maintenance medications and CMS quality  performance ratings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Taking medications as prescribed is imperative for their effectiveness. In populations such as Medicare, where two thirds of Medicare  beneficiaries have at least 2 or more chronic conditions requiring treatment with  medications and account for more than 90% of Medicare health care spend,  examining ways to improve medication adherence in patients with comorbidities is  warranted. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of pharmacy dispensing channel  (home delivery or retail pharmacy) with medication adherence for Medicare  patients taking medications with comorbid conditions of diabetes, hypertension,  and high blood cholesterol (3 of the top 5 most prevalent conditions), while  controlling for various confounders. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was  conducted using de-identified pharmacy claims data from a large national pharmacy  benefits manager between October 2010 and December 2012. Continuously eligible  Medicare Part D patients (Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan and  Prescription Drug Plan only) aged 65 years or older who had an antidiabetic,  antihypertensive, and antihyperlipidemic prescription claim between October and  December 2010 were identified and analyzed over a 2-year period. Multivariate  logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between dispensing  channel (DC) and medication adherence in calendar year (CY) 2012 controlling for  prior adherence behavior (adherence in CY2011), differences in demographics,  low-income subsidy status, days supply, disease burden, and drug-use pattern.  Patients with a proportion of days covered (PDC) of at least 80% for each of the  3 conditions were considered to be adherent, and patients with PDC less than 80%  for each of the 3 conditions were considered to be nonadherent. Patients were  assigned to a DC depending on where they filled at least 66.7% of their  prescriptions for each of the 3 conditions, and the rest were assigned to a mixed  channel group. RESULTS: The final analytical sample consisted of 40,632 patients.  The adjusted odds of adherence for patients using home delivery were 1.59 (95% CI  = 1.40-1.80) higher compared with patients using retail channels to obtain their  prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare Part D patients taking medications for  comorbid conditions who used home delivery had a greater likelihood (adjusted) of  adherence than patients who filled their antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and  antihyperlipidemic prescriptions using retail channels. Managed care stakeholders  looking to make informed decisions in a cost-constrained environment to assess,  implement, and promote solutions that improve health outcomes should consider the  use of home delivery of prescriptions to improve adherence for Medicare Part D  patients with comorbid conditions. DISCLOSURES: Funding for this study was  provided internally by Express Scripts Holding Company. Iyengar, LeFrancois,  Henderson, and Rabbitt are employees of Express Scripts. Study concept and design  were created by Iyengar and LeFrancois. Iyengar was responsible for acquisition  of data, statistical analysis, and interpretation of data.

AB  - The Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP, mm Hg) Intervention Trial (SPRINT) showed that targeting SBP <120 mm Hg (intensive treatment, mean SBP: 121.5 mm Hg) versus <140  (standard treatment, mean SBP: 134.6 mm Hg) reduced cardiovascular events 25%.  SPRINT has 2 implicit assumptions that could impact future US hypertension  guidelines: (1) standard therapy controlled SBP similarly to that in adults with  treated hypertension and (2) intensive therapy produced a lower mean SBP than in  adults with treated hypertension and SBP <140 mm Hg. To examine these  assumptions, US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009 to 2012  data were analyzed on 3 groups of adults with treated hypertension: group 1  consisted of SPRINT-like participants aged ≥50 years; group 2 consisted of  participants all aged ≥18 years; and group 3 consisted of participants aged ≥18  years excluding group 1 but otherwise similar to SPRINT-like participants except  high cardiovascular risk. Mean SBPs in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 133.0, 130.1, and  124.6, with 66.2%, 72.2%, and 81.9%, respectively, controlled to SBP <140; 68.3%,  74.8%, and 83.4% of the controlled subset had SBP <130. Mean SBPs in those  controlled to <140 were 123.3, 120.9, and 118.9, respectively. Among US adults  with treated hypertension, (1) the SPRINT-like group had higher mean SBP than  comparison groups, yet lower than SPRINT standard treatment group and (2) among  groups 1 to 3 with SBP <140, SBP values were within <3 mm Hg of SPRINT intensive  treatment. SPRINT results suggest that treatment should be continued and not  reduced when treated SBP is <130, especially for the SPRINT-like subset.  Furthermore, increasing the percentage of treated adults with SBP <140 could  approximate SPRINT intensive treatment SBP without lowering treatment goals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied whether care management is a pragmatic solution for improving population blood pressure (BP) control and addressing BP disparities  between Blacks and Whites in routine clinical environments. DESIGN:  Quasi-experimental, observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 3,964  uncontrolled hypertensive patients receiving primary care within the last year  from one of six Baltimore clinics were identified as eligible. INTERVENTION:  Three in-person sessions over three months with registered dietitians and  pharmacists who addressed medication titration, patient adherence to healthy  behaviors and medication, and disparities-related barriers. MAIN MEASURES: We  assessed the population impact of care management using the RE-AIM framework. To  evaluate effectiveness in improving BP, we used unadjusted, adjusted, and  propensity-score matched differences-in-differences models to compare those who  completed all sessions with partial completers and non-participants. RESULTS: Of  all eligible patients, 5% participated in care management. Of 629 patients who  entered care management, 245 (39%) completed all three sessions. Those completing  all sessions on average reached BP control (mean BP 137/78) and experienced 9 mm  Hg systolic blood pressure (P<.001) and 4 mm Hg DBP (P=.004) greater improvement  than non-participants; findings did not vary in adjusted or propensity-score  matched models. Disparities in systolic and diastolic BP between Blacks and  Whites were not detectable at completion. CONCLUSIONS: It may be possible to  achieve BP control among both Black and White patients who participate in a few  sessions of care management. However, the very limited reach and patient  challenges with program completion should raise significant caution with relying  on care management alone to improve population BP control and eliminate related  disparities.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a physician-led point of care medication delivery system (POCMDS) on adherence to glucose, blood pressure, and  cholesterol-lowering medications. STUDY DESIGN: Prepost intervention  observational study. METHODS: From December 15, 2010, to December 14, 2012, we  conducted a prepost analyses of 800 Medicare Advantage members receiving care in  a network of capitated clinics in south Florida serving a predominantly minority  population. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of diabetes for at least 1  year, taking at least 1 of the 3 classes of medications, and having received care  in the clinic network for at least for 12 months before and after the POCMDS  implementation. Our primary outcome is the medication possession ratio  (proportion of days covered [PDC]) for each class of medication. RESULTS: We  found an absolute increase of 17 percentage points (95% CI, 13-20) in the PDC for  oral antidiabetic agents, 29 (95% CI, 26-32) for cholesterol medications, and 21  (95% CI, 19-23) for blood pressure medications. Most of the subjects (80%)  reported POCMDS was more convenient than using retail pharmacies. By having the  POCMDS prioritize generic medications, the increases in adherence were not  associated with increased pharmacy costs. At baseline, over half the patients  were at goal for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, and  systolic blood pressure; thus, we did not detect any additional improvements in  these intermediate clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among elderly minority  patients with diabetes, a POCMDS improved adherence to various medications  classes without increasing pharmacy costs. Thus, POCMDS may be of interest to  policy makers, particularly in our current era of healthcare reform.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness and cost savings of a real-world, continuous, pharmacist-delivered service with an employed patient population with  diabetes over a 5-year period. SETTING: The Patients, Pharmacists Partnerships  (P(3) Program) was offered as an "opt-in" benefit to employees of 6 public and  private self-insured employers in Maryland and Virginia. Care was provided in ZIP  code-matched locations and at 2 employers' worksites. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Six  hundred two enrolled patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes were studied between  July 2006 and May 2012 with an average follow-up of 2.5 years per patient. Of  these patients, 162 had health plan cost and utilization data. A network of 50  trained pharmacists provided chronic disease management to patients with diabetes  using a common process of care. Communications were provided to patients and  physicians. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Employers provided incentives for patients who  opted in, including waived medication copayments and free diabetes  self-monitoring supplies. The service was provided at no cost to the patient. A  Web-based, electronic medical record that complied with the Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act helped to standardize care. Quality assurance  was conducted to ensure the standard of care. EVALUATION: Glycosylated hemoglobin  (A1c), blood pressure, and total health care costs (before and after enrollment).  RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were shown by mean decreases in  A1c (-0.41%, P <0.001), low-density lipoprotein levels (-4.7 mg/dL, P = 0.003),  systolic blood pressure (-2.3 mm Hg, P = 0.001), and diastolic blood pressure  (-2.4 mm Hg, P <0.001). Total annual health care costs to employers declined by  $1031 per beneficiary after the cost of the program was deducted. This 66-month  real-world study confirms earlier findings. Employers netted savings through  improved clinical outcomes and reduced emergency and hospital utilization when  comparing costs 12 months before and after enrollment. CONCLUSION: The P(3)  program had positive clinical outcomes and economic outcomes. Pharmacist-provided  comprehensive medication therapy management services should be included as a  required element of insurance offered by employers and health insurance  exchanges.

AB  - Elevated blood pressure (BP) is common in the emergency department (ED), but the relationship between antihypertensive medication adherence and BP in the ED is  unclear. This cross-sectional study tested the hypothesis that higher  antihypertensive adherence is associated with lower systolic BP (SBP) in the ED  among adults with hypertension who sought ED care at an academic hospital from  July 2012 to April 2013. Biochemical assessment of antihypertensive adherence was  performed using a mass spectrometry blood assay, and the primary outcome was  average ED SBP. Analyses were stratified by number of prescribed  antihypertensives (<3, ≥3) and adjusted for age, sex, race, insurance, literacy,  numeracy, education, body mass index, and comorbidities. Among 85 patients  prescribed ≥3 antihypertensives, mean SBP for adherent patients was 134.4 mm Hg  (±26.1 mm Hg), and in adjusted analysis was -20.8 mm Hg (95% confidence interval,  -34.2 to -7.4 mm Hg; P=0.003) different from nonadherent patients. Among 176  patients prescribed <3 antihypertensives, mean SBP was 135.5 mm Hg (±20.6 mm Hg)  for adherent patients, with no difference by adherence in adjusted analysis (+2.9  mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -4.7 to 10.5 mm Hg; P=0.45). Antihypertensive  nonadherence identified by biochemical assessment was common and associated with  higher SBP in the ED among patients who had a primary care provider and health  insurance and who were prescribed ≥3 antihypertensives. Biochemical assessment of  antihypertensives could help distinguish medication nonadherence from other  contributors to elevated BP and identify target populations for intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In 2009 and 2010, 17 primary care sites within 1 healthcare system became patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs), but the sites trained different  personnel (pharmacists vs nurses) to improve diabetes care using self-management  support (SMS). We report the challenges and successes of our efforts to: 1)  assemble a new multipayer (Medicare, Medicaid, commercial) claims dataset linked  to a clinical registry and 2) use the new dataset to perform comparative  effectiveness research on implementation of the 2 SMS models. STUDY DESIGN:  Longitudinal cohort study. METHODS: We lost permission to use private-payer data.  Therefore, we used claims from Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare/Medicaid  dual-eligible patients merged with chronic disease registry data. We studied 2008  to 2010, which included 1 year pre- and 1 year post the 2009 implementation time  period. Outcomes were outpatient and emergency department visits,  hospitalizations, care process (use of statin), and 3 intermediate outcomes  (glycemic control, blood pressure [BP], and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol  [LDL-C]). RESULTS: In our sample of 2826 patients, quality of care improved and  utilization decreased over the 2.5 years. Both approaches improved lipid control  (LDL-C decreased by an average of 4 mg/dL for pharmacy-SMS and 5.6 mg/dL for  nurse-SMS) and diastolic BP (-1.5 mm Hg for pharmacy-SMS and -1.3 mm Hg for  nurse-SMS), whereas only the pharmacy-led approach decreased primary care visits  (by 0.8 visits). The groups differed slightly on 2 measures (glycated hemoglobin,  systolic BP) with respect to the trajectory of improvement over time, but  performance was similar by 2.5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes care improved during  PCMH implementation systemwide, supporting both nurse-led and pharmacist-led SMS  models.

AB  - Physician-pharmacist collaboration improves blood pressure, but there is little information on whether this model can reduce the gap in healthcare disparities.  This trial involved 32 medical offices in 15 states. A clinical pharmacist was  embedded within each office and made recommendations to physicians and patients  in intervention offices. The purpose of the present analysis was to evaluate  whether the pharmacist intervention could reduce healthcare disparities by  improving blood pressure in high-risk racial and socioeconomic subjects compared  with the control group. The analyses in minority subjects were prespecified  secondary analyses, but all other comparisons were secondary, post hoc analyses.  The 9-month visit was completed by 539 patients: 345 received the intervention,  and 194 were in the control group. Following the intervention, mean systolic  blood pressure was found to be 7.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 2.4, 12.3)  lower in subjects from racial minority groups who received the intervention  compared with the control group (P=0.0042). Subjects with ≤12 years of education  in the intervention group had a systolic blood pressure 8.1 mm Hg (95% confidence  interval 3.2, 13.1) lower than the control group with lower education (P=0.0001).  Similar reductions in blood pressure occurred in patients with low incomes, those  receiving Medicaid, or those without insurance. This study demonstrated that a  pharmacist intervention reduced racial and socioeconomic disparities in the  treatment of blood pressure. Although disparities in blood pressure were reduced  by the intervention, there were still nonsignificant gaps in mean systolic blood  pressure when compared with intervention subjects not at risk.

PARTICIPANTS:  Twenty-five older adults using pharmacy delivery services for at least three  chronic medications. INTERVENTION: A pharmacist conducted a home-based CMR for  each participant. DTPs were identified across 13 categories. Patients received a  medication action plan post-CMR. A follow-up patient phone call was completed two  weeks following the appointment. Patient profiles were reviewed for three months  postintervention for changes in DTPs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in DTPs per  patient and changes in five Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  triple-weighted Star Rating performance measures. RESULTS: The average DTPs  identified per patient were reduced from 3.4 ± 2.06 to 1.48 ± 1.68 (P < 0.05)  DTPs three months postintervention. The most common categories  identified-nonadherence and incorrect administration/ technique-were  significantly reduced (P = 0.012 and P = 0.010, respectively). One Star Rating  performance measure significantly improved: 68% of patients taking hypertension  medications were adherent at baseline and 91% were adherent three months post-CMR  (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-provided, home-based CMRs reduced the average  number of DTPs per patient. The most common categories of DTPs  identified-nonadherence and incorrect administration/technique-were reduced  postintervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of a telephone call reminder program provided by a campus-based medication therapy management call center on medication  adherence in Medicare Advantage Part D (MAPD) beneficiaries with hypertension.  METHODS: The reminder call services were offered to eligible MAPD beneficiaries,  and they included a live interactive conversation with patients to assess the use  of their medications. This study used a quasi-experimental design for comparing  the change in medication adherence between the intervention and matched control  groups. Adherence, defined by proportion of days covered (PDC), was measured  using incurred medication claims 6 months before and after the adherence program  was implemented. A difference-in-differences approach with propensity score  matching was used. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, paired samples  included 563 patients in each of the intervention and control groups. The mean  PDC (standard deviation) increased significantly during postintervention period  by 17.3% (33.6; P <0.001) and 13.8% (32.3; P <0.001) for the intervention and the  control groups, respectively; the greater difference-in-differences increase of  3.5% (36.3) in the intervention group over the control group was statistically  significant (P = 0.022). A generalized estimating equation model adjusting for  covariates further confirmed that the reminder call group had a significant  increase in pre-post PDC (P = 0.021), as compared with the control group.  CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive medication adherence increased in both reminder  call and control groups, but the increase was significantly higher in the  intervention group. A telephonic outreach program was effective in improving  antihypertensive medication adherence in MAPD beneficiaries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To examine current patterns of hypertension (HTN) treatment in the United States, including blood pressure (BP) control, prevalence of different  antihypertensive agents, and variations in treatment associated with patient and  physician characteristics. METHODS: We used data from the National Disease and  Therapeutic Index (NDTI), a nationally representative physician survey produced  by QuintilesIMS. We selected patients with a diagnosis of HTN and identified  those prescribed antihypertensive therapies. We analyzed the type of  antihypertensive agents prescribed. Extent of BP control, and associated patient  and physician characteristics. We calculated 95% confidence intervals that  accounted for the multistage NDTI sampling design. RESULTS: Among those treated  for HTN in 2014, BP control varied: systolic BP (SBP) ≥160 (15%) vs. SBP 150-159  (9%) vs. SBP 140-149 (19%) vs. SBP 130-139 (26%) vs. SBP <130 (32%). Of those  treated for HTN, 29% used of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs);  24%, thiazide-like diuretics; 22%, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), 21%,  calcium-channel blockers (CCBs); and 19% beta-blockers. Newer drugs had very  limited uptake; no drugs approved after 2002 were used in more than 5% of  patients. Selection of agents varied only modestly by patient and physician  characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of HTN in 2014 predominantly involved  older medications in 5 major classes of drugs: ACEIs, thiazide diuretics, ARBs,  CCBs, and beta-blockers. Selection of antihypertensive agents showed limited  variation by age, gender, race, and insurance type. Although 58% of treated  patients had SBP <140, 24% had poorly controlled HTN with SBP ≥150, indicating  the need for improved treatment.

AB  - Blacks are two to three times as likely as whites to die of preventable heart disease and stroke. Declines in mortality from heart disease have not eliminated  racial disparities. Control and effective treatment of hypertension, a leading  cause of cardiovascular disease, among blacks is less than in whites and remains  a challenge. One of the driving forces behind this racial/ethnic disparity is  medication nonadherence whose cause is embedded in social determinants. Eight  practical approaches to addressing medication adherence with the potential to  attenuate disparities were identified and include: (1) patient engagement  strategies, (2) consumer-directed health care, (3) patient portals, (4) smart  apps and text messages, (5) digital pillboxes, (6) pharmacist-led engagement, (7)  cardiac rehabilitation, and (8) cognitive-based behavior. However, while data  suggest that these strategies may improve medication adherence, the effect on  ameliorating racial/ethnic disparities is not certain. This review describes the  relationship between disparities and medication adherence, which likely plays a  role in persistent disparities in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the current methods of medication therapy management (MTM) delivery have demonstrably improved therapeutic, safety, economic, and humanistic  health outcomes, patient- and prescriber-level barriers persist, limiting its  reach and effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To assess telephonic- and community-based  clinical pharmacy services in improving health indicators for rural, underserved  patients. METHODS: In 2014, an established MTM provider created a novel,  collaborative pilot program with independent retail and community health center  pharmacies to provide comprehensive, telephonic MTM services to rural Arizonans.  This pilot program used a combined telephonic- and community-based pharmacist  approach in the provision of MTM services for rural, underserved Arizona  populations. Adults with diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension, seen by a  prescriber or who filled prescriptions at a contracted, rural facility in 2014,  were eligible to participate. Initial MTM telephonic consultations were  conducted, and recommendations were communicated to patients' prescribers and/or  pharmacists. Patients received a follow-up telephone call at standard intervals,  depending on risk severity. RESULTS: A total of 517 patients participated, and  237 medication-related and 1,102 health promotion interventions were completed.  Positive trends were observed in fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose, and  diastolic blood pressure. Broad variation in prescriber acceptance of pharmacist  recommendations was observed (27%-60%). CONCLUSIONS: Study results provide  initial evidence to support the efficacy of collaborative efforts in the  provision of MTM services for improving health indicators and safety measures  while potentially reducing health care disparities. While the results are  encouraging, future research is warranted in more diverse populations and  settings.

AB  - Many ischemic stroke patients do not achieve goal blood pressure (BP < 140/90 mm Hg). To identify barriers to post-stroke hypertension management, we examined  healthcare utilization and BP control in the year after index ischemic stroke  admission. This retrospective cohort study included patients admitted for acute  ischemic stroke to a VA hospital in fiscal year 2011 and who were discharged with  a BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. One-year post-discharge, BP trajectories, utilization of  primary care, specialty and ancillary services were studied. Among 265 patients,  246 (92.8%) were seen by primary care (PC) during the 1-year post-discharge; a  median time to the first PC visit was 32 days (interquartile range: 53). Among  N = 245 patients with post-discharge BP data, 103 (42.0%) achieved a mean  BP < 140/90 mm Hg in the year post-discharge. Provider follow-ups were: neurology  (51.7%), cardiology (14.0%), nephrology (7.2%), endocrinology (3.8%), and  geriatrics (2.6%) and ancillary services (BP monitor [30.6%], pharmacy [20.0%],  nutrition [8.3%], and telehealth [8%]). Non-adherence to medications was  documented in 21.9% of patients and was observed more commonly among patients  with uncontrolled compared with controlled BP (28.7% vs 15.5%; P = .02). The  recurrent stroke rate did not differ among patients with uncontrolled (4.2%)  compared with controlled BP (3.8%; P = .89). Few patients achieved goal BP in the  year post-stroke. Visits to primary care were not timely. Underuse of specialty  as well as ancillary services and provider perception of medication non-adherence  were common. Future intervention studies seeking to improve post-stroke  hypertension management should address these observed gaps in care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite multiple treatment options, the prognosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains poor. PAH patients experience a high economic  burden due to comorbidities, hospitalizations, and medication costs. Although  combination therapy has been shown to reduce hospitalizations, the relationship  between treatment, health care utilization, and costs remains unclear. OBJECTIVE:  To provide a characterization of health care utilization and costs in real-world  settings by comparing periods before and after initiating PAH-specific treatment.  METHODS: This retrospective study identified PAH patients in the Truven Health  MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases between 2010 and 2014  who initiated treatment with endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs),  phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5Is), or soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)  stimulators. The index date was the date of the first PAH pharmacy claim. We  included patients with ≥ 2 medical claims with diagnoses for PAH (ICD-9-CM:  416.0, 416.8) or PAH-related conditions and continuous enrollment in medical and  pharmacy benefits for the 6 months before and after the index date. Treatment  patterns were assessed at the drug class level (ERAs, PDE-5Is, sGC stimulators,  and prostacyclins) from outpatient pharmacy claims during the 6-month post-index  period. All-cause and PAH-related utilization and costs were measured. McNemar's  and paired t-tests were used to compare patients' health care resource  utilization and costs in the 6-month pre- and posttreatment periods. RESULTS: A  total of 3,908 patients met the selection criteria. The study sample was 63%  female with a mean age of 63 ± 15 years. Only 5% of patients began initial  combination therapy for PAH, defined as claims for ≥ 2 medication classes within  the first 30 days of treatment. Treatment interruption (≥ 30-day gap in days  supply) of any PAH-specific medication was observed in 38% of patients. Compared  with the 6-month pre-index period, the proportion of patients in the 6-month  post-index period with any inpatient admission decreased, 42% versus 30% (P <  0.001). In addition, PAH-related inpatient admissions decreased in the 6-month  post-index period from 7% to 3% (P < 0.001). After treatment initiation,  patients' nonpharmacy medical costs decreased from $48,200 (SD = $117,686) to  $33,962 (SD = $90,294; P < 0.001), mainly attributable to reduced inpatient  costs. However, total average medical costs including pharmacy costs remained  comparable after treatment initiation (pre-index period = $51,455 vs. post-index  period = $53,923; P = 0.213). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that while patients'  PAH-related pharmacy costs increased after treatment initiation, the increase was  offset by reduced inpatient utilization; therefore, total health care costs  remained constant. While the majority of patients in this study were treated with  monotherapy, the recently completed AMBITION study indicated that initial  combination therapy with ambrisentan plus tadalafil reduced PAH-related  hospitalizations compared with initial monotherapy with either of these agents.  Future cost analyses of patients treated with combination therapy will be  required to determine the economic effect of initial combination therapy.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the 4 non-pharmacological strategies adopted by patients for hypertension control and patient characteristics that affect the  choice of strategies. Four thousand hypertensive patients aged ≥18 years were  selected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Odds ratios  of the choice of strategies were analyzed using weighted logistic models.  Clinical recommendations of non-pharmacological strategies for hypertension  control were relatively low. More exercise was the least frequent strategy used  for hypertension control. More patients reported using ≥3 strategies than using  ≤2 strategies (79.1% vs 20.9%, P < .0001). Non-Hispanic blacks were more likely  to use each individual strategy and to use ≥3 strategies simultaneously. Patients  with obesity and diabetes were less likely to attempt weight control or more  exercise, but more likely to use ≥3 strategies than peers. Educational programs  should be developed to enhance physician's advice for lifestyle modifications and  to increase patient's acceptance of physical activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To 1) identify barriers to medication adherence and 2) examine the relationship between the Indian Health Service (IHS) 3 prime questions and  medication adherence in patients with diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia  before and 6 months after intervention. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study  evaluated the effectiveness of an adherence program at an independent community  pharmacy. Patients who met inclusion criteria were telephoned monthly to answer  questions related to their medications. Patients served as their own controls to  show comparison between pre- and postintervention adherence rates calculated  according to proportion of days covered over the previous 6 months. Mean  medication adherences before and after intervention were assessed via paired t  test. Linear regression was used to analyze predictors of average medication  adherence. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used to measure the impact of  comorbid conditions on medication adherence. RESULTS: Fifty-six of 354 patients  met inclusion criteria, consented, and completed the study. The percentage of  patients achieving an adherence rate of 80% or more increased from 9% initially  to 59% at study completion. Each medication class showed improvement in adherence  rates: diabetes from 66.24% to 80.06% (P = 0.0153), hypertension from 72.33% to  81.34% (P = 0.0192), and hyperlipidemia from 64.45% to 74.66% (P = 0.0103).  Overall, average medication adherence increased by 11% (P < 0.0001). The top  patient-reported barrier to adherence was convenience/forgetfulness (46.43%).  CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-led counseling sessions with the use of the 3 prime  questions showed short-term improvement in adherence rates among patients  participating in a medication adherence program. Future studies should assess if  improved adherence is sustained long-term following active intervention.

AB  - The emphasis that United States employers are placing on employee wellness continues to grow; however, most attention has been paid to larger firms to gauge  return-on-investment from a larger pool of enrollees. With fewer resources  available to fund expansive wellness programs, smaller businesses need a  cost-effective mechanism to provide such benefits. As the most accessible  healthcare provider, community pharmacists are in an ideal position to support  certain wellness programs for smaller businesses. This research piloted a  community pharmacist-led, employer-sponsored wellness program for a self-insured  financial services company in Tennessee. Employees with diabetes, hypertension,  hyperlipidemia, asthma, or COPD were recruited from the partnering firm to  receive live, one-on-one counseling from a community pharmacist over a calendar  year. Each session was tailored to individual employee's needs and goals but  generally focused on medication adherence, diet, exercise, and health maintenance  strategies. Fifteen employees participated in the program, and improvements in  clinical measures were not realized over the course of a year. Some, albeit not  statistically significant, improvements were seen in self-reported medication  adherence and quality of life; however, a trend toward some weight gain was  observed. Results suggest that, similar to Medicare beneficiaries, working-age  adults with certain chronic conditions may benefit from pharmacist-led MTM  programs but deeper investigation is needed.

AB  - PURPOSE: Expansion of clinical pharmacist positions through sustainable funding is described. SUMMARY: The University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and  Pharmaceutical Sciences was awarded a 2-year program grant to establish an  integrated clinical pharmacy program for underserved residents in family health  centers in northeastern Colorado. The grant enabled the hiring of 2 bilingual,  full-time, board-certified, postgraduate year 2-trained clinical pharmacists to  initiate comprehensive clinical pharmacy services. Clinical pharmacy services for  diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia management were provided during direct  patient care visits using collaborative drug therapy management protocols to  facilitate comprehensive medication management. Initial visits lasted 1 hour, and  follow-up visits lasted 30 minutes. In addition, clinical pharmacists provided  point-of-care consultations for patients seeing other healthcare providers. All  patient encounters and consultations were documented in the electronic health  record. Success of the clinical pharmacy program was evaluated based on the  achievement of goal blood pressure values, glycosylated hemoglobin values, and  low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Pharmacists' involvement in patient  care activities led to improvements in all of these clinical outcomes. This  coincided with unique funding opportunities with regional accountable care  organizations that sought to demonstrate improved patient care in an expansion  population. As a result, 2 grant-funded clinical pharmacist positions in 2  community health clinics were converted into 4 faculty positions in 5 community  health centers funded by regional accountable care organizations. CONCLUSION:  Collaboration with accountable care organizations resulted in the successful  funding of ambulatory care clinical pharmacy services. These services resulted in  improved chronic disease control and provider satisfaction.

AB  - Medication synchronization programs based in pharmacies simplify the refill process by enabling patients to pick up all of their medications on a single  visit. This can be especially important for improving medication adherence in  patients with complex chronic diseases. We evaluated the impact of two  synchronization programs on adherence, cardiovascular events, and resource use  among Medicare beneficiaries treated between 2011 and 2014 for two or more  chronic conditions-at least one of which was hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or  diabetes. Among nearly 23,000 patients matched by propensity score, the mean  proportion of days covered (a measure of medication adherence) for the control  group of patients without a synchronization program was 0.84 compared to 0.87 for  synchronized patients-a gain of 3 percentage points. Adherence improvement in  synchronized versus control patients was three times greater in patients with low  baseline adherence, compared to those with higher baseline adherence. Rates of  hospitalization and emergency department visits and rates of outpatient visits  were 9 percent and 3 percent lower in the synchronized group compared to the  control group, respectively, while cardiovascular event rates were similar.  Synchronization programs were associated with improved adherence for patients  with cardiovascular disease, especially those with low baseline adherence.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effectiveness and costs associated with addition of pharmacist-led group medical visits to standard care for patients with Type-2  Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is unknown. METHODS: Randomized-controlled-trial in  three US Veteran Health Administration (VHA) Hospitals, where 250 patients with  T2DM, HbA1c >7% and either hypertension, active smoking or hyperlipidemia were  randomized to either (1) addition of pharmacist-led group-medical-visits or (2)  standard care alone for 13 months. Group (4-6 patients) visits consisted of  2-hour, education and comprehensive medication management sessions once weekly  for 4 weeks, followed by quarterly visits. Change from baseline in cardiovascular  risk estimated by the UKPDS-risk-score, health-related quality-of-life (SF36v)  and institutional healthcare costs were compared between study arms. RESULTS:  After 13 months, both groups had similar and significant improvements from  baseline in UKPDS-risk-score (-0.02 ±0.09 and -0.04 ±0.09, group visit and  standard care respectively, adjusted p<0.05 for both); however, there was no  significant difference between the study arms (adjusted p = 0.45). There were no  significant differences on improvement from baseline in A1c,  systolic-blood-pressure, and LDL as well as health-related quality-of-life  measures between the study arms. Compared to 13 months prior, the increase in  per-person outpatient expenditure from baseline was significantly lower in the  group visit versus the standard care arm, both during the study intervention  period and at 13-months after study interventions. The overall VHA healthcare  costs/person were comparable between the study arms during the study period (p =  0.15); then decreased by 6% for the group visit but increased by 13% for the  standard care arm 13 months post-study (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Addition of  pharmacist-led group medical visits in T2DM achieved similar improvements from  baseline in cardiovascular risk factors than usual care, but with reduction in  the healthcare costs in the group visit arm 13 months after completion compared  to the steady rise in cost for the usual care arm.

AB  - PURPOSE: A telehealth-based chronic disease management program including clinical pharmacy specialists (CPSs) and the program's impact on primary care outcomes in  a population of veterans are described. SUMMARY: A telehealth program including  CPS services was developed to improve healthcare access and quality for veterans  in rural areas of the Pacific Northwest. Outcomes of medication management  services provided by a CPS team during both clinical video telehealth and  telephone encounters with 554 patients from October 2014 to March 2017 were  assessed. Patients were targeted for diabetes (DM), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and  hypertension (HTN) control and tobacco cessation; the respective primary outcomes  were the mean changes from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and  blood pressure values and rates of guideline-indicated statin therapy and tobacco  cessation. Patients in the DM and HTN groups had a mean absolute HbA(1c)  reduction of 1.61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-1.83%; p < 0.0001) and a  mean systolic blood pressure reduction of 26.00 mm Hg (95% CI, 22.99-28.50 mm Hg;  p < 0.001), respectively. In the HLD group, 93% of patients were discharged on a  lipid-lowering medication. Tobacco cessation was achieved in 42% of targeted  patients. CONCLUSION: CPSs providing primary care comprehensive medication  management services solely via telehealth improved disease management and access  to healthcare in a population of rural veterans. Statistically significant  improvements in DM and HTN outcomes were demonstrated along with clinically  significant improvements in the areas of lipid management and tobacco cessation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the rate of guideline-concordant initiation of oral anticoagulation (OAC) among elderly Veterans with atrial fibrillation (AF) and  high stroke risk. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Veterans Health Administration  (VHA) Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) linked with Medicare claims 2011-2015. STUDY  DESIGN: We identified 6619 elderly, high stroke-risk patients with a new episode  of AF initially diagnosed in the VHA during fiscal years 2012-2015. We used  logistic regression to estimate marginal effects of associations between patient  characteristics and OAC initiation within 90 days of the first AF episode. DATA  EXTRACTION METHODS: We identified OACs using generic drug names. We calculated  comorbidities and risk scores using diagnosis codes from 1 year of baseline data.  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Overall, 66.5% of Medicare-eligible Veterans with AF at high  risk of stroke initiated an OAC within 90 days. We found lower initiation rates  for patients enrolled in Medicare Part D and those ineligible for drug co-payment  subsidies. OAC initiation rates increased during the study among VHA-reliant  patients but not among dual VHA-Part D enrollees. CONCLUSIONS: One-third of  elderly Veterans at risk of stroke are not receiving recommended therapy.  Increased coordination between Medicare and VHA providers may lead to  improvements in anticoagulation quality and stroke prevention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension remains poorly controlled on the population level. National rates of control, even when defined leniently by BP < 140/90 mm Hg, are  only ~50%. As growing healthcare costs coincide with tighter blood pressure (BP)  targets, innovative management programs are needed to maximize efficiency of care  delivery and optimize control. HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to develop a remote,  navigator-led hypertension innovation program that would leverage algorithmic  care pathways, home BP measurements and patient coaching to allow rapid and  complete medication titration. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of clinical  experts from subspecialties and primary care collaborated to develop an  evidence-based clinical algorithm, designed to be automated and administered by  non-licensed patient navigators. In the development stage, a prospective pilot  cohort of 130 patients was managed by nurse practitioners and pharmacists to  ensure efficacy and safety. Patients with clinic BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg were enrolled  and given a Bluetooth-enabled BP device. Home BPs were transmitted automatically  into the electronic medical record. Medication titrations were performed by phone  at biweekly intervals, based upon weekly average BP, until home BP was controlled  at <135/85 mm Hg. RESULTS: Eighty-one percent of all enrolled, and 91% of those  patients who regularly measured home BP achieved goal, in an average of 7 weeks.  Control was reached similarly across races, genders, and ages. CONCLUSIONS: A  home-based BP control program run by non-physicians can provide efficient,  effective and rapid control, suggesting an innovative paradigm for hypertension  management. This program is effective, sustainable, adaptable, and scalable to  fit current and emerging national systems of healthcare.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since its introduction to the market in 2016, selexipag has been an alternative oral therapy among both treatment-naïve patients and those with mono  or dual therapy failure; however, limited information is available regarding the  presentation and management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension  (PAH) prior to selexipag initiation. This study examined treatment patterns,  healthcare utilization, and costs in the 12 months prior to and the 6 months  following selexipag initiation. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of adult  commercial and Medicare Advantage with Part D (MAPD) health plan members with a  medical or pharmacy claim for selexipag from 1 January 2016 through 31 May 2017,  a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, and continuous health plan enrollment for  12 months prior to selexipag initiation (baseline period). Treatment patterns,  healthcare utilization, and costs were measured over the baseline period and the  6 months following selexipag initiation (among patients with ⩾6 months of follow  up). RESULTS: After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, 95 patients  were included in the analysis. At study start, 57.9% of patients were prescribed  combination therapy, increasing to 69.5% immediately prior to selexipag  initiation. Approximately 60% of patients had one baseline regimen. Emergency  visits and inpatient admissions during the baseline period occurred in 63.2% and  48.4% of patients, respectively. Baseline medical costs rose steadily, increasing  266.8% in commercial and 26.7% in MAPD enrollees from the beginning to the end of  the 12-month baseline period. PAH-related healthcare costs accounted for more  than 80% of total costs. Mean medical costs in the 6 months following selexipag  initiation were US$17,215 in commercial and US$23,976 in MAPD enrollees.  CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with PAH remained on the same therapy in  the 12 months prior to selexipag initiation despite high rates of healthcare  utilization and increasing costs. Mean medical costs appeared to decrease after  adding or switching to selexipag.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is highly prevalent among the low-income population in the United States. This study assessed the association between Medicaid coverage  and health care service use and costs among hypertensive adults following the  enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), by income  status level. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 2,866 nonpregnant  hypertensive individuals aged 18-64 years with income up to 138% of the federal  poverty level (FPL) were selected from the 2014 and 2015 Medical Expenditure  Panel Survey. Regression analyses were performed to examine the association of  Medicaid coverage with outpatient (outpatient visits and prescription medication  fills), emergency, and acute health care service use and costs among those  potentially eligible for Medicaid by income status-the very low-income (FPL ≤  100%) and the moderately low-income (100% > FPL ≤ 138%). RESULTS: Among the study  population, 70.1% were very low-income and 29.9% were moderately low-income.  Full-year Medicaid coverage was higher among the very low-income group (41.0%)  compared with those moderately low-income (29.1%). For both income groups, having  full-year Medicaid coverage was associated with increased health care service use  and higher overall annual medical costs ($13,085 compared with $7,582 without  Medicaid); costs were highest among moderately low-income patients ($17,639).  CONCLUSION: Low-income individuals with hypertension, who were potentially newly  eligible for Medicaid under the ACA may benefit from expanded Medicaid coverage  by improving their access to outpatient services that can support chronic disease  management. However, to realize decreases in medical expenditures, efforts to  decrease their use of emergency and acute care services are likely needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nearly half of Americans with diagnosed hypertension have uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) while some integrated healthcare systems, such  as Kaiser Permanente Northern California, have achieved control rates upwards  90%. METHODS AND RESULTS: We adapted Kaiser Permanente's evidence-based treatment  protocols in a racially and ethnically diverse population at 12 safety-net  clinics in the San Francisco Health Network. The intervention consisted of 4  elements: a hypertension registry, a simplified treatment intensification  protocol that included fixed-dose combination medications containing diuretics,  standardized BP measurement protocol, and BP check visits led by registered nurse  and pharmacist staff. The study population comprised patients with hypertension  who made ≥1 primary care visits within the past 24 months (n=15 917) and had a  recorded BP measurement within the past 12 months. We conducted a  postintervention time series analysis from August 2014 to August 2016 to assess  the effect of the intervention on BP control for 24 months for the pilot site and  for 15 months for 11 other San Francisco Health Network clinics combined.  Secondary outcomes were changes in use of guideline-recommended medication  prescribing. Rates of BP control increased at the pilot site (68%-74%; P<0.01)  and the 11 other San Francisco Health Network clinic sites (69%-74%; P<0.01).  Statistically significant improvements in BP control rates (P<0.01) at the 11 San  Francisco Health Network clinic sites occurred in all racial and ethnic groups  (blacks, 60%-66%; whites, 69%-75%; Latinos, 67%-72%; Asians, 78%-82%). Use of  fixed-dose combination medications increased from 10% to 13% (P<0.01), and the  percentage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prescriptions dispensed in  combination with a thiazide diuretic increased from 36% to 40% (P<0.01).  CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based system approaches to improving BP control can be  implemented in safety-net settings and could play a pivotal role in achieving  improved population BP control and reducing hypertension disparities.

TI  - Economic implications with newer agents to reduce cardiovascular risk in diabetes.
AU  - McAdam-Marx, Carrie
T2  - The American journal of managed care
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) plays a significant role in the morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes (T2D). In addition to the negative impact on the  health of patients, people with T2D and CVD encounter higher total healthcare  costs compared with patients with T2D and without CVD. The FDA guidance of 2008  recommending cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) for T2D drug candidates  prompted pharmaceutical companies to conduct such studies. Some of those drug  candidates appear to have beneficial physiologic effects on cardiovascular  outcomes. Pharmacoeconomic analysis can correlate observed improvements to  cardiovascular outcomes to savings in healthcare spending and assist health plans  in assessing the value of diabetes medications. To date, most pharmacoeconomic  studies for antihyperglycemic drugs have been conducted using surrogate markers  of CVD risk (eg, glycated hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, body mass index,  plasma lipid levels) and have established the economic benefit and value of  diabetes drugs based on reduction in cardiovascular events. A few analyses have  been conducted based on CVOT efficacy data and similarly demonstrate value in  patients at high CVD risk. Combined, the pharmacoeconomic data reinforce that  newer agents with CVOT benefit represent good value in general, as well as for  patients with high CVD risk, and support managed care decisions regarding  treatment coverage and recommendations for newer diabetes agents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We developed a new model of hypertension care for non-Hispanic black men that links health promotion by barbers to medication management by American  Society of Hypertension-certified pharmacists and demonstrated efficacy in a  6-month cluster-randomized trial. The marked reduction in systolic blood pressure  (BP) seen at 6 months warranted continuing the trial through 12 months to test  sustainability, a necessary precondition for implementation research. METHODS: We  enrolled a cohort of 319 black male patrons with systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg at  baseline. Fifty-two Los Angeles County barbershops were assigned to either a  pharmacist-led intervention or an active control group. In the intervention  group, barbers promoted follow-up with pharmacists who prescribed BP medication  under a collaborative practice agreement with patrons' primary care providers. In  the control group, barbers promoted follow-up with primary care providers and  lifestyle modification. After BP assessment at 6 months, the intervention  continued with fewer in-person pharmacist visits to test whether the intervention  effect could be sustained safely for 1 year while reducing pharmacist travel  time. Final BP and safety outcomes were assessed in both groups at 12 months.  RESULTS: At baseline, mean systolic BP was 152.4 mm Hg in the intervention group  and 154.6 mm Hg in the control group. At 12 months, mean systolic BP fell by 28.6  mm Hg (to 123.8 mm Hg) in the intervention group and by 7.2 mm Hg (to 147.4  mm Hg) in the control group. The mean reduction was 20.8 mm Hg greater in the  intervention (95% CI, 13.9-27.7; P<0.0001). A BP <130/80 mm Hg was achieved by  68.0% of the intervention group versus 11.0% of the control group ( P<0.02).  These new 12-month efficacy data are statistically indistinguishable from our  previously reported 6-month data. No treatment-related serious adverse events  occurred in either group over 12 months. Cohort retention at 12 months was 90% in  both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among black male barbershop patrons with uncontrolled  hypertension, health promotion by barbers resulted in large and sustained BP  reduction over 12 months when coupled with medication management by American  Society of Hypertension-certified pharmacists. Broad-scale implementation  research is both justified and warranted. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:  https://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Unique identifier: NCT 02321618.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Blood pressure control among patients with hypertension is a widely recognized quality metric, but many large health systems fail to reach targets  set by the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set. We developed an  interactive voice response (IVR) system called the "Mobile You Blood Pressure  Program" at a large academic medical center and linked it to the health system's  electronic health record (EHR). The goal of the program was to capture home blood  pressure readings in the EHR and to alert ambulatory care clinical pharmacists  automatically of readings below or above clinical thresholds through direct  messaging in the EHR. The goal of this report is to describe implementation of  IVR, initial patient participation rates, and pharmacist-identified barriers to  patient enrollment. SETTING: Ambulatory care clinical pharmacist specialists'  practice in 14 clinics in family medicine and internal medicine at Michigan  Medicine, an academic health system serving more than 24,000 patients with a  diagnosis of hypertension. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: This study describes  implementation and initial patient enrollment in IVR linked to the EHR for home  blood pressure monitoring. EVALUATION: We tracked the number of hypertensive  patients enrolled and IVR call completion rates between September 2017 and  February 2018. We also assessed pharmacist-identified barriers to patient  enrollment during 2 separate 2-week intervals in January and February 2018.  RESULTS: Between September 1, 2017, and February 28, 2018, a total of 71 patients  were enrolled from 14 clinics. Patients were scheduled for 1-3 IVR calls per week  focusing on medication adherence and blood pressure control. A total of 936 IVR  phone calls were made, with 488 (52%) calls completed. Access to a validated home  blood pressure monitor was the largest pharmacist-identified barrier to patient  enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: The IVR Mobile You Blood Pressure Program represents a  new application of digital technology within our health system.  Pharmacist-identified barriers to patient participation included access to a  validated home blood pressure monitor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interindividual variability in blood pressure (BP) response to antihypertensives has been reported. Although plasma renin activity (PRA) is a  potential biomarker for personalizing antihypertensive therapy in European  American (EA) and African American (AA) hypertensives, clinical utility of  PRA-guided prescribing is incompletely understood. METHODS: Using  systematic-phased approach, PRA's clinical utility was assessed. After  categorizing by baseline PRA, clinic systolic BP (SBP) responses to metoprolol  and chlorthalidone were compared in 134 EAs and 102 AAs enrolled in the  Pharmacogenomics Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses-2 (PEAR-2) trial.  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted in EAs. Data from  PEAR-2 AAs were used to estimate an optimal PRA cut point using multivariable  linear regression models. The derived cut point in AAs was tested in a  meta-analysis of 2 independent AA cohorts, and its sensitivity and specificity  were assessed. RESULTS: EAs with PRA < 0.65 ng/ml/hour had a greater decrease in  SBP to chlorthalidone than metoprolol (by -15.9 mm Hg, adjusted P < 0.0001),  whereas those with PRA ≥ 0.65 ng/ml/hour had a greater decrease in SBP to  metoprolol than chlorthalidone (by 3.3 mm Hg, adjusted P = 0.04). Area under ROC  curve (0.69, P = 0.0001) showed that PRA can predict SBP response among EAs.  However, we observed no association between PRA and SBP response in PEAR-2 AAs.  Among independent AA cohorts, those with PRA ≥ 1.3 ng/ml/hour (PEAR-2-derived cut  point) responded better to atenolol/candesartan than hydrochlorothiazide  (meta-analysis P = 0.01). However, sensitivity of the derived cut point was 10%.  CONCLUSIONS: PRA at the previously established 0.60-0.65 ng/ml/hour cut point is  an effective predictive biomarker of BP response in EAs. However, we were unable  to identify PRA cut point that could be used to guide antihypertensive selection  in AAs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01203852, NCT00246519, NCT00005520.

AB  - The shift to a value-based health care system has incentivized providers to implement strategies that improve population health outcomes while minimizing  downstream costs. Given their accessibility and expanded clinical care models,  community pharmacists are well positioned to join interdisciplinary care teams to  advance efforts in effectively managing the health of populations. In this  Viewpoints article, we discuss the expanded role of community pharmacists and  potential barriers limiting the uptake of these services. We then explore  strategies to integrate, leverage, and sustain these services in a value-based  economy. Although community pharmacists have great potential to improve  population health outcomes because of their accessibility and clinical  interventions that have demonstrated improved outcomes, pharmacists are not  recognized as merit-based incentive eligible providers and, as a result, may be  underutilized in this role. Additional barriers include lack of formal billing  codes, which limits patient access to services such as hormonal contraception;  fragmentation of Medicare, which prevents alignment of medical and pharmaceutical  costs; and continued fee-for-service payment models, which do not incentivize  quality. Despite these barriers, there are several opportunities for continued  pharmacist involvement in new care models such as patient-centered medical homes  (PCMH), accountable care organizations, and other value-based payment models.  Community pharmacists integrated within PCMHs have demonstrated improved  hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure control, and immunization rates. Likewise, other  integrated, value-based models that used community pharmacists to provide  medication therapy management services have reported a positive return on  investment in overall health care costs. To uphold these efforts and effectively  leverage community pharmacist services, we recommend the following: (a)  recognition of pharmacists as providers to facilitate full participation in  performance-based models, (b) increased integration of pharmacists in emerging  delivery and payment models with rapid cycle testing to further clarify the role  and value of pharmacists, and (c) enhanced collaborative relationships between  pharmacists and other providers to improve interdisciplinary care. DISCLOSURES:  This article was funded by the National Association of Chain Drug Stores. The  authors have no potential conflicts of interest to report.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the potential health and budgetary impacts of implementing a pharmacist-involved team-based hypertension  management model in the United States. RESEARCH DESIGN: In 2017, we evaluated a  pharmacist-involved team-based care intervention among 3 targeted groups using a  microsimulation model designed to estimate cardiovascular event incidence and  associated health care spending in a cross-section of individuals representative  of the US population: implementing it among patients with: (1) newly diagnosed  hypertension; (2) persistently (≥1 year) uncontrolled blood pressure (BP); or (3)  treated, yet persistently uncontrolled BP-and report outcomes over 5 and 20  years. We describe the spending thresholds for each intervention strategy to  achieve budget neutrality in 5 years from a payer's perspective. RESULTS:  Offering this intervention could prevent 22.9-36.8 million person-years of  uncontrolled BP and 77,200-230,900 heart attacks and strokes in 5 years  (83.8-174.8 million and 393,200-922,900 in 20 years, respectively). Health and  economic benefits strongly favored groups 2 and 3. Assuming an intervention cost  of $525 per enrollee, the intervention generates 5-year budgetary cost-savings  only for Medicare among groups 2 and 3. To achieve budget neutrality in 5 years  across all groups, intervention costs per person need to be around $35 for  Medicaid, $180 for private insurance, and $335 for Medicare enrollees.  CONCLUSIONS: Adopting a pharmacist-involved team-based hypertension model could  substantially improve BP control and cardiovascular outcomes in the United  States. Net cost-savings among groups 2 and 3 make a compelling case for  Medicare, but favorable economics may also be possible for private insurers,  particularly if innovations could moderately lower the cost of delivering an  effective intervention.

T2  - Pediatric pulmonology
AB  - The multidisciplinary team in a pediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH) center can improve the delivery of care to the PH patient by helping them address the  different challenges that correlate to a PH diagnosis. Currently, there are a  limited number of accredited pediatric PH centers nationwide, and many healthcare  facilities have little experience managing patients with this complex and rare  disease. Patients with PH may see providers from multiple medical specialties,  inherit a high-cost burden from their PH medications, and have little community  backing due to unfamiliarity of the disease. The multidisciplinary team can  embrace these challenges. Through the delineation of tasks and roles within the  composition of the team, patients can experience the support, resources, and care  they need. The composition of the team can vary from center to center, but it may  include an attending physician, advanced practice provider, nurse, dietitian,  physiologists, respiratory therapists, social workers, research coordinators, and  subspecialty collaboration including cardiology, pulmonology, genetics,  psychology, and palliative care. When composing a multidisciplinary team,  consider the heterogeneity of the patient population being served. Look at the  resources available and overall community familiarity with PH. It is important to  know the center's limits and refer to an expert PH center as necessary. The goal  for every patient with pulmonary hypertension is to maximize their quality of  life and outcomes, and the use of the multidisciplinary team is one approach to  reaching this goal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) reported that intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment reduced cardiovascular disease and  mortality compared to standard BP treatment in hypertension patients. The next  important question is how to implement more intensive BP treatment in real-world  clinical practice. We designed an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial to  simultaneously test the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention for  intensive BP treatment and its feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability in  underserved hypertension patients. METHODS: Implementation of Multifaceted  Patient-Centered Treatment Strategies for Intensive Blood Pressure Control  (IMPACTS) is a cluster randomized trial conducted in 36 Federally Qualified  Health Center clinics in Louisiana and Mississippi. Federally Qualified Health  Center clinics were randomized to either a multifaceted intervention for  intensive BP treatment, including protocol-based treatment using the SPRINT  intensive BP management algorithm, dissemination of SPRINT findings, BP audit and  feedback, home BP monitoring, and health coaching, or enhanced usual care.  Difference in mean systolic BP change from baseline to 18 months is the primary  clinical effectiveness outcome, and intervention fidelity, measured by treatment  intensification and medication adherence, is the primary implementation outcome.  The planned sample size of 1,260 participants (36 clinics with 35 participants  each) has 90% power to detect a 5.0-mm Hg difference in systolic BP at a .05  significance level and 80% follow-up rate. CONCLUSIONS: IMPACTS will generate  critical data on the effectiveness and implementation of a multifaceted  intervention for intensive BP treatment in real-world clinical practice and could  directly impact the BP-related disease burden in minority and low-income  populations in the United States.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Veterans Health Administration implemented a pilot program for primary care intensive management (PIM) for patients at high risk for  hospitalization. We examined the impact of the program on medication adherence  and adjustments for patients with chronic conditions. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized  quality improvement trial was conducted in 5 sites in which high-risk patients  were randomized into PIM or usual primary care; outcomes were measured in the 12  months before and after randomization. Interdisciplinary PIM teams assessed  patients for unmet needs and offered services including pharmaceutical care and  care coordination. METHODS: Outcomes included adherence, measured by proportion  of days covered, and several measures of medication adjustments for diabetes,  depression, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension medications.  Differences-in-differences methods were used to estimate changes in outcomes  between PIM and usual care groups. RESULTS: There were 1527 patients in the  medication adherence cohort and 1719 in the medication adjustments cohort. Mean  adherence was mostly similar between groups but 16% higher among PIM patients for  dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (for diabetes) after randomization  (0.12 vs -0.04; P = .02). The mean number of hyperlipidemia drugs filled was  higher among PIM patients (1.1 vs 1.0; P = .006). The mean number of discontinued  depression medications was higher and the mean number of dose changes for  hypertension medications was lower for PIM patients, although these comparisons  did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Medication adherence  improved for DPP-4 inhibitors, and more hyperlipidemia drugs were prescribed for  PIM patients. Overall impacts of PIM were modest.

T2  - Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication therapy management (MTM) was officially recognized by the federal government in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and  Modernization Act of 2003, which requires Medicare Part D plans that offer  prescription drug coverage to establish MTM programs (MTMPs) for eligible  beneficiaries. Even though the term "MTM" was first used in 2003, pharmacists  have provided similar services since the term "pharmaceutical care" was  introduced in 1990. Fairview Health Services, a large integrated health care  system, implemented a standardized pharmaceutical care service system in 1998,  naming it a pharmaceutical care-based MTM practice in 2006. OBJECTIVE: To present  the clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes of 10 years of delivering MTM  services to patients in a health care delivery system. METHODS: Data from MTM  services provided to 9,068 patients and documented in electronic therapeutic  records were retrospectively analyzed over the 10-year period from September 1998  to September 2008 in 1 health system with 48 primary care clinics. Patients  eligible for MTM services were aged 21 years or older and either paid for MTM out  of pocket or met their health care payer's criteria for MTM reimbursement; the  criteria varied for Medicaid, Medicare, and commercially insured enrollees. All  MTM was delivered face to face. Health data extracted from the electronic  therapeutic record by the present study's investigators included patient  demographics, medication list, medical conditions, drug therapy problems  identified and addressed, change in clinical status, and pharmacist-estimated  cost savings. The clinical status assessment was a comparison of the first and  most recent MTM visit to measure whether the patient achieved the goals of  therapy for each medical condition (e.g., the blood pressure of a patient with  diabetes and hypertension will be less than 130/80 millimeters mercury [mmHg] in  1 month; the patient with allergic rhinitis will be relieved of his complaints of  nasal congestion, runny nose, and eye itching within 5 days). Goals were set  according to evidence-based literature and patient-specific targets determined  cooperatively by pharmacists, patients, and physicians. Cost-savings calculations  represented MTM pharmacists' estimates of medical services (e.g., office visits,  laboratory services, urgent care visits, emergency room visits) and lost work  time avoided by the intervention. All short-term (3-month) estimated health care  savings that resulted from addressing drug therapy problems were analyzed. The  expenses of these avoided services were calculated using the health system's  contracted rates for services provided in the last quarter of 2008. The return on  investment (ROI) was calculated by dividing the pharmacist-estimated savings by  the cost of MTM services in 2008 (number of MTM encounters times the average cost  of an MTM visit). The humanistic impact of MTM services was assessed using the  results from the second patient satisfaction survey administered in 2008 (new  patients seen from January through December 2008) for the health system's MTM  program. RESULTS: A total of 9,068 patient records were in the documentation  system as of September 30, 2008. During the 10-year period, there were 33,706  documented encounters (mean 3.7 encounters per patient). Of 38,631 drug therapy  problems identified and addressed by MTM pharmacists, the most frequent were a  need for additional drug therapy (n = 10,870, 28.1%) and subtherapeutic dosage (n  = 10,100, 26.1%). In the clinical status assessment of the 12,851 medical  conditions in 4,849 patients who were not at goal when they enrolled in the  program, 7,068 conditions (55.0%) improved, 2,956 (23.0%) were unchanged, and  2,827 (22.0%) worsened during the course of MTM services. Pharmacist-estimated  cost savings to the health system over the 10-year period were $2,913,850 ($86  per encounter) and the total cost of MTM was $2,258,302 ($67 per encounter), for  an estimated ROI of $1.29 per $1 in MTM administrative costs. In the patient  satisfaction survey, 95.3% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that their  overall health and well-being had improved because of MTM. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist  estimates of the impact of an MTM program in a large integrated health care  system suggest that the program was associated with improved clinical outcomes  and cost savings. Patient satisfaction with the program was high. DISCLOSURES:  There was no external funding for this manuscript. The 3 authors are employees of  Fairview Pharmacy Services. Ramalho de Oliveira had primary responsibility for  the concept and design, writing, and revision of the manuscript, with the  assistance of Brummel and Miller. Ramalho de Oliveira performed the data  collection, and all 3 authors shared equally in data interpretation.

AB  - Heart disease and stroke are leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and high blood pressure is a major risk factor for both. Community  pharmacists are readily positioned to improve cardiovascular health through  services such as medication therapy management and self-management education. In  2018, the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health,  and NeuGen, a not-for-profit health insurer, piloted a pharmacist-led medication  therapy management program for people with hypertension in partnership with 8  community pharmacies. We evaluated changes in use of blood pressure  self-management tools and barriers to antihypertensive medication adherence  before and after medication therapy management services. Participant satisfaction  was also assessed for the 59 participants at the end of the program. We observed  improvements in self-reported use of self-management tools, reductions in  medication adherence barriers, and high satisfaction with pharmacist care. This  collaborative pilot resulted in sustainable reimbursement for participating  pharmacies delivering medication therapy management services to eligible NeuGen  members.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Mississippi Delta has high rates of chronic disease and is known for its poor health outcomes and health disparities. The University of  Mississippi School of Pharmacy (UMSOP) and the Mississippi State Department of  Health partnered in 2009 through the Mississippi Delta Health Collaborative to  reduce health disparities and improve clinical outcomes by expanding the UMSOP's  evidence-based medication therapy management (MTM) initiative, focused in  Mississippi's 18-county Delta region, to federally qualified health centers  (FQHCs) in 4 of those counties. METHODS: Between January 2009 and August 2018,  the MTM initiative targeted FQHC patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis  of diabetes, hypertension, and/or dyslipidemia. Pharmacists initially met  face-to-face with patients to review all medications, provide education about  chronic diseases, identify and resolve drug therapy problems, and take  appropriate actions to help improve the effectiveness of medication therapies.  Clinical parameters evaluated were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood  pressure (DBP), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,  triglycerides, and hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)). RESULTS: The analysis included 335  patients with hypertension (n = 287), dyslipidemia (n = 131), and/or diabetes (n  = 331). Significant mean reductions occurred in the following metrics: SBP (7.1  mm Hg), DBP (6.3 mm Hg), LDL cholesterol (24.9 mg/dL), triglycerides (45.5  mg/dL), total cholesterol (37.7 mg/dL), and HbA(1c) (1.6% [baseline ≥6%] and 1.9%  [baseline ≥9%]). CONCLUSION: Despite the cultural and environmental disadvantages  present in the Mississippi Delta, the integrated MTM treatment program  demonstrated significant health improvements across 3 chronic diseases:  hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. This model demonstrates that a  partnership between public health and pharmacy is a successful and innovative  approach to care.

AB  - Despite the importance of antihypertensive medication therapy for blood pressure control, no single data system provides estimates of medication nonadherence  rates across age groups and health insurance plans types. Using multiple  administrative datasets and national survey data, we determined health insurance  plan-specific and overall weighted national rates of nonadherence to  antihypertensive medications among insured hypertensive US adults in 2015. We  used 2015 prescription claims data from Medicare Part D and 3 IBM MarketScan  databases (Commercial, Medicaid, Medicare Supplemental) to calculate medication  nonadherence rates among hypertensive adults aged ≥18 years with public or  private health insurance using the proportion of days covered algorithm. These  findings, in combination with National Health Interview Survey findings, were  used to project national weighted estimates of nonadherence. We included 23.8  million hypertensive adults who filled 265.8 million prescriptions for  antihypertensive medications. Nonadherence differed by health insurance plan type  (highest for Medicaid members, 55.4%; lowest for Medicare Part D members, 25.2%).  The overall weighted national nonadherence rate was 31.0%, with greater  nonadherence among women versus men, younger versus older adults (aged 18-34  years, 58.1%; aged 65-74 years, 24.4%), fixed-dose combination medication  nonusers (31.2%) versus users (29.4%), and by pharmacy outlet type (retail only,  30.7%; any mail order, 19.8%). In 2015, almost one-third (≈16.3 million) of  insured US adults with diagnosed hypertension were considered nonadherent to  their antihypertensive medication regimen, and considerable disparities were  evident. Public health and healthcare professionals can use available  evidence-based interventions to address nonadherence and improve blood pressure  control.

T2  - Currents in pharmacy teaching & learning
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This qualitative focus group study sought to describe how colleges of pharmacy use simulation-based learning (SBL) to teach cardiovascular topics  and to identify challenges and benefits. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants were  recruited from a screening survey disseminated via e-mail to select American  College of Clinical Pharmacy Practice and Research networks. Subjects were  selected based on diversity in institution and simulation types. Two 1-hour focus  group sessions were conducted by the primary investigator following a script  designed by the research team. Each recorded session was independently reviewed  by all investigators and coded into final themes. Results are reported in a  qualitative fashion. RESULTS: Five individuals provided consent and participated.  Themes identified include topics, formats, interprofessional education,  challenges, strategies for success, and benefits. Frequent topics included  advanced cardiac life support, heart failure, hypertension, and transitions of  care. Multiple formats were used including standardized patients or providers,  task trainers, and high-fidelity mannequins. Multiple institutions reported  simulating interprofessional teams by involving students from other health  professions. Scheduling, pharmacy program size, faculty availability, and  logistics around planning and/or conducting an event were identified challenges.  Institutions reported success when clear expectations were provided to students  and skill development progressed from low-stakes to high-stakes events. Benefits  reported included real world applicability with participants noting that students  do not realize the importance of SBL until they have reached rotations.  CONCLUSIONS: Various topics and simulation methods were employed to teach  cardiovascular topics. While challenges exist, institutions have identified  strategies for success and report students recognized the benefits to their  learning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical services provided by pharmacists embedded in practices can improve patient outcomes within the primary care setting. Little is known about  whether physician organizations (POs) will retain the services of clinical  pharmacists after outside funding for a statewide implementation program is  ended. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a statewide program, Michigan Pharmacists  Transforming Care and Quality (MPTCQ), that incorporated pharmacists within 17  POs. METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted using data collected from June  2016 to September 2018 from primary care clinical pharmacist encounters in POs  participating in MPTCQ. Process outcomes included the number of participating  POs, patient encounters, and average visits per patient. Analyses at the  encounter level were stratified by 2 encounter types: disease state management  (DSM) or comprehensive medication review (CMR). Separately by encounter type,  pharmacist effect was described by the number, type, and reasons for medication  changes, as well as medication adherence and cost barriers found and addressed.  Clinical outcomes included hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure change.  Sustainability and patient satisfaction of pharmacists providing clinical  services are reported. RESULTS: Across 17 POs, 27 pharmacists participated in the  MPTCQ program. Pharmacists completed 24,523 patient encounters for DSM with 5,942  patients, with an average of 5 visits per patient with diabetes and 2 visits for  hypertension. Pharmacists made 15,153 therapeutic medication changes during  visits for diabetes and hypertension, with approximately 70% related to efficacy.  Pharmacists completed 4,203 CMR visits for 3,092 patients. During CMR visits,  1,296 therapeutic medication changes were recommended. Problems with medication  cost were identified in 13% of CMR visits. Blood pressure and A1c levels  decreased in patients managed by pharmacists. In 157 patients surveyed, 87% rated  their pharmacists' care as excellent. Sixteen POs retained their pharmacists at  the end of funding. CONCLUSIONS: A statewide provider-payer partnership  successfully integrated and retained primary care pharmacists within POs.  Pharmacists in the MPTCQ program contributed to improvements in disease control  by changing medications to improve patient clinical outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Uncontrolled hypertension is a common cause of cardiovascular disease, which is the deadliest and costliest chronic disease in the United  States. Pharmacists are an accessible community healthcare resource and are  equipped with clinical skills to improve the management of hypertension through  medication therapy management (MTM). Nevertheless, current reimbursement models  do not incentivize pharmacists to provide clinical services. We aim to  investigate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist-led comprehensive MTM clinic  compared with no clinic for 10-year primary prevention of stroke and  cardiovascular disease events in patients with hypertension. METHODS: We built a  semi-Markov model to evaluate the clinical and economic consequences of an MTM  clinic compared with no MTM clinic, from the payer perspective. The model was  populated with data from a recently published controlled observational study  investigating the effectiveness of an MTM clinic. Methodology was guided using  recommendations from the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and  Medicine, including appropriate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared with no  MTM clinic, the MTM clinic was cost-effective with an incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio of $38 798 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.  The incremental net monetary benefit was $993 294 considering a  willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY. Health-benefit benchmarks at  $100 000 per QALY and $150 000 per QALY translate to a 95% and 170% increase from  current reimbursement rates for MTM services. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows  current reimbursement rates for pharmacist-led MTM services may undervalue the  benefit realized by US payers. New reimbursement models are needed to allow  pharmacists to offer cost-effective clinical services.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the process of creating precepted, student pharmacist-led health outreach events at long-term care facilities and to describe the lessons  learned during the implementation process. SETTING: Yakima, Washington, a  medically underserved area. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Pharmacy students, supervised  by pharmacist preceptors, conducted health outreach events at local long-term  care facilities on a rotating monthly basis. These students provided  comprehensive medication reviews, blood pressure screenings, and blood glucose  screenings. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Pharmacists providing medication reviews at  long-term care facilities where residents manage their medications can address  polypharmacy by identifying medication discrepancies, determining the  effectiveness of treatment, and improving patient outcomes. Conducting health  outreach events with pharmacy-student involvement includes the added benefit of  providing students with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience before  beginning their clinical Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) rotations  and practice skills described in the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists  Geriatric Pharmacy Curriculum Guide and Pharmacist's Patient Care Process.  RESULTS: Nineteen health outreach events at long-term care facilities were held,  and more than 100 residents participated annually. Students coordinated events  successfully after developing a standardized set of questions, which was  necessary for planning, and identifying someone to act as an event coordinator,  recruiting students and ensuring they were appropriately trained, and creating a  monitoring form to be filled in and shared with the participant. Students learned  key lessons including naming the events appropriately to avoid confusion,  understanding that not all long-term care facilities are alike, deciding how many  students to recruit from each cohort to participate in events, optimizing the  preceptor-to- student ratio, and ensuring preceptors were thorough in their  oversight of students. CONCLUSION: This work described the implementation of  health outreach events conducted by supervised student pharmacists at long-term  care facilities. Health outreach events could be conducted by other colleges or  facilities to provide important medication review and health screening services  for long-term care facilities' residents, as well as providing student  pharmacists with opportunities to learn and practice patient-care related skills.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To characterize the barriers and opportunities associated with racial and ethnic disparities in blood pressure (BP) control. RECENT FINDINGS:  Blood pressure (BP) control rates in the USA have worsened over the last decade,  with significantly lower rates of control among people from racial and ethnic  minority groups, with non-Hispanic (NH) Black persons having 10% lower control  rates compared to NH White counterparts. Many factors contribute to BP control  including key social determinants of health (SDoH) such as health literacy,  socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare as well as low awareness rates and  dietary habits. Numerous pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions have  been developed to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in BP control. Among  these, dietary programs designed to help reduce salt intake, faith-based  interventions, and community-based programs have found success in achieving  better BP control among people from racial and ethnic minority groups.  Disparities in the prevalence and management of hypertension persist and remain  high, particularly among racial and ethnic minority populations. Ongoing efforts  are needed to address SDoH along with the unique genetic, social, economic, and  cultural diversity within these groups that contribute to ongoing BP management  inequalities.

AB  - Background: Sacubitril/valsartan was approved for New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in 2015,  based on the results of the PARADIGM-HF trial, which showed a reduction in  cardiovascular (CV) death and heart failure hospitalization, compared with  enalapril. A subsequent subgroup analysis of the trial showed glycemic  improvement for patients on sacubitril/valsartan compared with those on  enalapril. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study at the Loma  Linda University (LLU) International Heart Institute (IHI). The aim was to  evaluate the association of sacubitril/valsartan with glycemic index and other  metabolic parameters, including change in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), blood pressure  (BP), ejection fraction (EF), body weight, and lipid profile from baseline and at  3, 6, and 12 months. The rates of CV-related hospitalizations and total  hospitalizations were also assessed. Results: The change in mean HbA1C from  baseline was not significantly different at 1 year (P = 0.993). The mean EF was  significantly higher and the mean diastolic BP was significantly lowered. Body  weight and lipid parameters remained unchanged. Both the rates of CV-related  hospitalizations and total hospitalizations were significantly lowered. For the  prespecified subgroup analysis of diabetic HFrEF patients, the mean HbA1C was  nonsignificant at 12 months (mean difference -0.48, P = 0.993). Conclusion: A  non-significant reduction in HbA1C was associated in HFrEF patients with diabetes  mellitus. Large randomized trials are needed to confirm our findings regarding  the potential metabolic benefits of sacubitril/valsartan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although medication therapy management (MTM) has specific eligibility criteria and is mandated for specific Medicare Part D enrollees, some health  plans have expanded MTM eligibility beyond the minimum criteria to include other  Medicare Part D enrollees, Medicaid, and commercial health plan patients.  Differences exist in the mode of delivery, location of services, type of  personnel involved in managing the service, and the subsequent outcomes. The type  and intensity of MTM services delivered have evolved with time to more  streamlined and robust interventions, necessitating ongoing evaluation of the  effect on clinical and economic outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of  changes to an existing MTM program on cost of care, utilization, and medication  adherence. METHODS: UPMC Health Plan made changes to an existing MTM program by  expanding eligibility (customized by the type of health plan), intervention  types, pharmacist involvement, and patient followup contacts. After matching our  intervention cohort (identified January 2017-June 2018) with the pre-2016 MTM  historical controls (patients identified January 2014-June 2015 who would have  been eligible if we used the intervention cohort eligibility criteria), we  estimated that the effect of the program changes with a difference-in-difference  model (preintervention [2014-2016] and postintervention [2017-2019]). Outcomes of  interest included cost (total cost of care including medical, pharmacy, and  unplanned care [i.e., unscheduled health care use such as emergency department  visits] in 2017 U.S. dollars); utilization; medication adherence (proportion of  days covered); and return on investment (ROI). Target population included  continuously enrolled patients aged ≥ 21 years in the commercial, Medicare, and  Medicaid health plans. RESULTS: Total propensity score-matched members was  10,747, 55% of which were in the historic control group. The average (SD) ages  after matching the groups were similar (historical control group: 57.08 years  [14.23], intervention group: 56.79 years [14.21]) and the majority was female  (57%). Comorbidities identified most for patients included hypertension (77%),  dyslipidemia (70%), and diabetes (52%). Forty-one percent were in the commercial,  37% in the Medicaid, and 23% in the Medicare health plans. Proportion of care  activities undertaken in the intervention period compared with the control period  were significantly different: "sent letter to physician" (67% vs. 87%), "sent  letter to member" (15% vs. 0%), "pharmacist phone call to physician" (15% vs.  0.1%), and "pharmacist phone call to member" (13% vs. 7%). There were  statistically significant reductions in unplanned care across all health plans  especially in the Medicare population, in total cost of care, and increases in  medication adherence in 4 therapeutic classes: anticoagulants (OR = 1.25, P =  0.005), cardiac medications (OR = 1.20, P < 0.001), statins (OR = 1.21, P <  0.001), and antidepressants (OR = 1.15, P < 0.001). There was a positive ROI of  $18.50 per dollar spent, which equated to a cumulative net savings of $11 million  over 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: In a large health plan, expanding MTM eligibility,  intensifying patient follow-up contact and pharmacist involvement, and improving  provider awareness had favorable clinical and economic benefits. DISCLOSURES:  There was no funding for this project except employees' time. All authors are  employees of UPMC and have no conflicts of interest to report.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The burden of diabetes is exceptionally high among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) peoples. The Indian Health Service (IHS) and Tribal  health programs provide education, case management, and advanced practice  pharmacy (ECP) services for AI/ANs with diabetes to improve their health  outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate patient outcomes  associated with ECP use by AI/AN adults with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN: This  observational study included the analysis of IHS data for fiscal years (FY)  2011-2013. Using propensity score models, we assessed FY2013 patient outcomes  associated with FY2012 ECP use, controlling for FY2011 baseline characteristics.  SUBJECTS: AI/AN adults with diabetes who used IHS and Tribal health services  (n=28,578). MEASURES: We compared health status and hospital utilization outcomes  for ECP users and nonusers. RESULTS: Among adults with diabetes, ECP users,  compared with nonusers, had lower odds of high systolic blood pressure [odds  ratio (OR)=0.85, P<0.001] and high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR=0.89,  P<0.01). Among adults with diabetes absent cardiovascular disease (CVD) at  baseline, 3 or more ECP visits, compared with no visits, was associated with  lower odds of CVD onset (OR=0.79, P<0.05). Among adults with diabetes and CVD,  any ECP use was associated with lower odds of end-stage renal disease onset  (OR=0.60, P<0.05). ECP users had lower odds of 1 or more hospitalizations  (OR=0.80, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Findings on positive patient outcomes associated  with ECP use by adults with diabetes may inform IHS and Tribal policies, funding,  and enhancements to ECP services to reduce disparities between AI/ANs and other  populations in diabetes-related morbidity and mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients living in rural communities often experience pronounced health disparities, have a higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, and  poorer access to care compared to urban areas. To address these unmet healthcare  service needs, an established, academic-based MTM provider created a novel,  collaborative program to provide comprehensive, telephonic services to patients  living in rural Arizona counties. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the program  effectiveness and described differences in health process and outcome measures  (e.g., clinical outcomes, gaps in care for prescribed medications,  medication-related problems) between individuals residing in different  rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) groups (urban, micropolitan, and small town) in  rural Arizona counties. METHODS: Subjects eligible for inclusion were 18 years or  older with diabetes and/or hypertension, living in rural Arizona counties. Data  were collected on: demographic characteristics, medical conditions, clinical  values, gaps in care, medication-related problems (MRPs), and health promotion  guidance. Subjects were analyzed using 3 intra-county RUCA levels (i.e., urban,  micropolitan, and small town). RESULTS: A total of 384 patients were included  from: urban (36.7%), micropolitan (19.3%) and small town (44.0%) areas. Positive  trends were observed for clinical values, gaps in care, and MRPs between initial  and follow-up consultations. Urban dwellers had significantly lower average SBP  values at follow-up than those from small towns (p < 0.05). A total of 192 MRPs  were identified; 75.0% were resolved immediately or referred to providers and  16.7% were accepted by prescribers. CONCLUSION: This academic-community  partnership highlights the benefits of innovative collaborative programs, such as  this, for individuals living in underserved, rural areas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have documented factors influencing medication nonadherence among the Medicare population, but few studies have examined  medication nonadherence among the Medicare low-income subsidy (LIS) population.  Furthermore, little is known about the factors associated with nonadherence among  this population, especially those with prevalent chronic conditions such as type  2 diabetes, hypertension, or heart failure. OBJECTIVE: To examine factors  associated with the likelihood of medication nonadherence among Medicare LIS  recipients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or heart failure. METHODS: This  was a retrospective analysis of 2012-2013 Medicare Parts A, B, and D claims (most  recent available for this research) linked to the Area Health Resources Files.  Beneficiaries aged 65 years or older with continuous Medicare coverage and  receiving any LIS were included. Individuals were categorized into full LIS or  partial LIS groups. Nonadherence was determined by the proportion of days covered  less than 80% for specified oral type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure  medications, as defined by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance. A multivariate logistic  regression was used to determine and compare individual-level and community-level  characteristics associated with nonadherence among the entire study sample, the  full LIS group, and the partial LIS group. RESULTS: The study sample included  505,771 Medicare beneficiaries, with 448,509 (88.7%) receiving full LIS and  57,262 (11.3%) receiving partial LIS. The proportion of individuals nonadherent  was higher among the full LIS population (33.2%) than that of the partial LIS  population (30.8%). Among the entire population, younger age was associated with  nonadherence (OR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.98-0.99). Men were more likely to be  nonadherent than women (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.11-1.14). Compared with  non-Hispanic Whites, racial/ethnic minorities had higher nonadherence. Compared  with beneficiaries who were non-Hispanic White, the ORs for those who were Black,  Hispanic, Asian, and other were 1.41 (95% CI = 1.38-1.43), 1.58 (95% CI =  1.55-1.61), 1.08 (95% CI = 1.05-1.11), and 1.63 (95% CI = 1.56-1.70),  respectively. There were higher nonadherence rates among patients living in  communities with lower socioeconomic characteristics, such as a metropolitan  statistical area (MSA vs non-MSA; OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.04-1.07). A higher risk  adjustment summary score, indicating worse health status, was associated with an  increased likelihood of medication nonadherence (OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.20-1.22).  These patterns were similar among the full and partial LIS groups. CONCLUSIONS:  Individual- and community-level characteristics were associated with the  likelihood of medication nonadherence among Medicare LIS recipients with type 2  diabetes, hypertension, or heart failure. These characteristics included younger  age, male sex, racial/ethnic minorities, living in lower socioeconomic  communities, and a higher risk adjustment summary score. This study provided  insight into medication nonadherence within the Medicare LIS population and  identified the need to consider these factors when developing future policies to  improve medication adherence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) is the second leading cause of death from blunt trauma. In the present study, we aimed to determine the outcomes  of medical management (MM) for BTAI. We hypothesized from the results of several  previously reported studies, that patients with a minimal aortic injury (BTAI  grades 1 and 2) could safely be treated with definitive MM alone. METHODS: The  Aortic Trauma Foundation international prospective multicenter registry was used  to examine the demographics, injury characteristics, management, and outcomes of  patients with BTAI. We analyzed a subset of patients for whom MM was initiated as  definitive therapy. RESULTS: From November 2016 to April 2020, 432 patients  (median age, 41 years; 76% male; median injury severity score, 34) with BTAI  (Society for Vascular Surgery grade 1, 23.6%; grade 2, 14.4%; grade 3, 51.2%;  grade 4, 10.9%) were evaluated. Of the 432 patients, 245 (57%) had received MM in  the initial period and 114 (26.4%) had received MM as the planned definitive  therapy (grade 1, 59.6%; grade 2, 23.7%; grade 3, 15.8%; grade 4, 0.9%). The most  common mechanism of BTAI was a motor vehicle collision (60.4%). Hypotension was  present on arrival in 74 patients (17.2%). Continuous titratable infusion of  antihypertensive medication was used for 49.1%, followed by intermittent bolus  administration (29.8%), with beta-blockers (74.6%) the most common agent used.  Treatments were targeted to a goal systolic blood pressure for 83.3%, most often  to a target goal systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg (66.3%). The MM goals based  on blood pressure control were attained in 64.0% (73 of 114). Twelve patients  (10.5%; grade 1, 1; grade 2, 0; grade 3, 10; grade 4, 1) had required subsequent  intervention after MM. Eleven patients (9.6%) had undergone thoracic endovascular  aortic repair and one (0.9%) had required open repair for a grade 4 injury. The  overall in-hospital mortality for patients selected for definitive MM was 7.9%.  No aortic-related deaths had occurred in the patients receiving definitive MM.  CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one in four patients with BTAI will receive MM as  definitive therapy. The variation in the pharmacologic therapies used is  considerable. MM for patients with minimal aortic injury (BTAI grades 1 and 2) is  safe and effective, with a low overall intervention rate and no aortic-related  deaths. These findings support the use of definitive MM for grade 2 BTAI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment nonadherence and clinical inertia perpetuate poor cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor control. Telemedicine interventions may counter both treatment nonadherence and clinical inertia. INTRODUCTION: We explored why a telemedicine intervention designed to reduce treatment nonadherence and clinical inertia did not improve CVD risk factor control, despite enhancing treatment adherence versus usual care. METHODS: In this analysis of a randomized trial, we studied recipients of the 12‐month telemedicine intervention. This intervention comprised two nurse‐administered components: (1) monthly self‐management education targeting improved treatment adherence; and (2) quarterly medication management facilitation designed to support treatment intensification by primary care (thereby reducing clinical inertia). For each medication management facilitation encounter, we ascertained whether patients met treatment goals, and if not, whether primary care recommended treatment intensification following the encounter. We assessed disease control associated with encounters, where intensification was/was not recommended. RESULTS: We examined 455 encounters across 182 intervention recipients (100% African Americans with type 2 diabetes). Even after accounting for valid reasons for deferring intensification (e.g., treatment nonadherence), intensification was not recommended in 67.5% of encounters in which hemoglobin A1c was above goal, 72.5% in which systolic blood pressure was above goal, and 73.9% in which low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol was above goal. In each disease state, treatment intensification was more likely with poorer control. CONCLUSIONS: Despite enhancing treatment adherence, this intervention was unsuccessful in countering clinical inertia, likely explaining its lack of effect on CVD risk factors. We identify several lessons learned that may benefit investigators and healthcare systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite well‐publicized guidelines on the appropriate management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, implementation of risk‐reducing practices remains poor. This paper describes the rationale and design of a randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a comprehensive program of CVD risk reduction delivered by nurse practitioner (NP)/community health worker (CHW) teams versus enhanced usual care in improving the proportion of patients in urban community health centers who achieve goal levels recommended by national guidelines for lipids, blood pressure, HbA1c and prescription of appropriate medications. METHODS: The COACH (Community Outreach and Cardiovascular Health) trial is a randomized controlled trial in which patients at federally‐qualified community health centers were randomly assigned to one of two groups: comprehensive intensive management of CVD risk factors for one year by a NP/CHW team or an enhanced usual care control group. RESULTS: A total of 3899 patients were assessed for eligibility and 525 were randomized. Groups were comparable at baseline on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with the exception of statistically significant differences in total cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a novel amalgam of multilevel interdisciplinary strategies to translate highly efficacious therapies to low‐income federally‐funded health centers that care for patients who carry a disproportionate burden of CVD, type 2 diabetes and uncontrolled CVD risk factors. The impact of such a community clinic‐based intervention is potentially enormous.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic conditions often use complex medical regimens. A nurse‐led strategy to support medication therapy management incorporated into primary care teams may lead to improved use of medications for disease control. Electronic health record (EHR) tools may offer a lower‐cost, less intensive approach to improving medication management. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Northwestern and Access Community Health Network Medication Education Study is a health center‐level cluster‐randomized trial being conducted within a network of federally qualified community health centers. Health centers have been enrolled in groups of 3 and randomized to (1) usual care, (2) EHR‐based medication management tools alone, or (3) EHR tools plus nurse‐led medication therapy management. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension who are prescribed ≥ 3 medications of any kind are recruited from the centers. EHR tools include a printed medication list to prompt review at each visit and automated plain‐language medication information within the after‐visit summary to encourage proper medication use. In the nurse‐led intervention, patients receive one‐on‐one counseling about their medication regimens to clarify medication discrepancies and identify drug‐related concerns, safety issues, and nonadherence. Nurses also provide follow‐up telephone calls following new prescriptions and periodically to perform medication review. The primary study outcome is systolic blood pressure after 1 year. Secondary outcomes include measures of understanding of dosing instructions, discrepancies between patient‐reported medications and the medical record, adherence, and intervention costs. CONCLUSIONS: The Northwestern and Access Community Health Network Medication Education Study will assess the effects of 2 approaches to support outpatient medication management among patients with uncontrolled hypertension in federally qualified health center settings.

AB  - TRIAL DESIGN: to further validate the FORTA (Fit fOR The Aged) concept, a bicentric randomised, controlled trial was run in two geriatric clinics. METHODS: patients (≥65 years, ≥3 drugs or ≥60 years, ≥6 drugs) with three relevant diseases and hospitalisation for ≥5 days were randomised. In the intervention, but not the control group, a FORTA team instructed ward physicians on FORTA. FORTA is the first positive/negative listing approach labelling medications used to treat chronic illnesses in older patients from A (indispensable), B (beneficial), C (questionable) to D (avoid). The primary end point was the FORTA score: sum of medication errors classified as over‐, under‐ and mistreatment. Consecutive patients were randomised to the intervention and control ward; outcome assessment was blinded. RESULTS: four hundred and nine patients (age 81.5 years, 64% female, hospitalisation 17.4 days) were included. The primary end point was significantly (P < 0.0001) more reduced in the intervention versus control groups (2.7 ± 2.25 versus 1 ± 1.8, mean ± SD, intergroup comparison of admission/discharge differences). Over‐ and under‐treatment scores and use of A (increase) and D (decrease) drugs were significantly improved (P < 0.01). The total number of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was significantly reduced by FORTA (P < 0.05, number needed to treat is 5). Activities of daily living and renal failure improved significantly (P < 0.05). Blood pressure remained constant in the intervention, but decreased significantly in the control group. CONCLUSION: applying FORTA to hospitalised geriatric patients leads to improvement of medication quality and may improve secondary clinical end points (e.g. ADRs). The concept is amenable to successful communication and implementation. Registration (DRKS‐ID): DRKS00000531. FUNDING: DFG‐German Research Foundation (WE 1184/15‐1).

AB  - BACKGROUND: In resource‐poor areas of China and India, the cardiovascular disease burden is high, but availability of and access to quality healthcare is limited. Establishing a management scheme that utilizes the local infrastructure and builds healthcare capacity is essential for cardiovascular disease prevention and management. The study aims to develop, implement, and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a simplified, evidence‐based cardiovascular management program delivered by community healthcare workers in resource‐constrained areas in Tibet, China and Haryana, India. METHODS/DESIGN: This yearlong cluster‐randomized controlled trial will be conducted in 20 villages in Tibet and 20 villages in Haryana. Randomization of villages to usual care or intervention will be stratified by country. High cardiovascular disease risk individuals (aged 40 years or older, history of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or measured systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg or higher) will be screened at baseline. Community health workers in the intervention villages will be trained to manage and follow up high‐risk patients on a monthly basis following a simplified '2+2' intervention model involving two lifestyle recommendations and the appropriate prescription of two medications. A customized electronic decision support system based on the intervention strategy will be developed to assist the community health workers with patient management. Baseline and follow‐up surveys will be conducted in a standardized fashion in all villages. The primary outcome will be the net difference between‐group in the proportion of high‐risk patients taking antihypertensive medication pre‐ and post‐intervention. Secondary outcomes will include the proportion of patients taking aspirin and changes in blood pressure. Process and economic evaluations will also be conducted. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be the first study to evaluate the effect of a simplified management program delivered by community health workers with the help of electronic decision support system on improving the health of high cardiovascular disease risk patients. If effective, this intervention strategy can serve as a model that can be implemented, where applicable, in rural China, India, and other resource‐constrained areas. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database on 30 December, 2011 and the registration number is NCT01503814.

AB  - Discontinuation of angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is recommended if patients experience ≥30% acute increase in serum creatinine after starting this therapy. However, the long‐term effects of its continuation or discontinuation on major clinical outcomes after increases in serum creatinine are unclear. In the ADVANCE trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation), 11 140 diabetes mellitus patients were randomly assigned to perindopril‐indapamide or placebo after a 6‐week active run‐in period. The current study included 11 066 participants with 2 serum creatinine measurements recorded before and during the active run‐in period (3 weeks apart). Acute increase in creatinine was determined using these 2 measurements and classified into 4 groups: increases in serum creatinine of <10%, 10% to 19%, 20% to 29%, and ≥30%. The primary study outcome was the composite of major macrovascular events, new or worsening nephropathy, and all‐cause mortality. An acute increase in serum creatinine was associated with an elevated risk of the primary outcome ( P for trend <0.001). The hazard ratios were 1.11 (95% CI, 0.97‐1.28) for those with an increase of 10% to 19%, 1.34 (1.07‐1.66) for 20% to 29%, and 1.44 (1.15‐1.81) for ≥30%, compared with <10%. However, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in the benefit of randomized treatment effects on the outcome across subgroups defined by acute serum creatinine increase ( P for heterogeneity=0.94). Acute increases in serum creatinine after starting perindopril‐indapamide were associated with greater risks of subsequent major clinical outcomes. However, the continuation of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor‐based therapy reduced the long‐term risk of major clinical outcomes, irrespective of acute increase in creatinine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lack of timely medication intensification and inadequate medication safety monitoring are two prevalent and potentially modifiable barriers to effective and safe chronic care. Innovative applications of health information technology tools may help support chronic disease management. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical impact of a novel health IT tool designed to facilitate between‐visit ordering and tracking of future laboratory testing. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Clinical trial randomized at the provider level (n = 44 primary care physicians); patient‐level outcomes among 3,655 primary care patients prescribed 5,454 oral medicines for hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and/or hypertension management over a 12‐month period. MAIN MEASURES: Time from prescription to corresponding follow‐up laboratory testing; proportion of follow‐up time that patients achieved corresponding risk factor control (A1c, LDL); adverse event laboratory monitoring 4 weeks after medicine prescription. KEY RESULTS: Patients whose physicians were allocated to the intervention (n = 1,143) had earlier LDL laboratory assessment compared to similar patients (n = 703) of control physicians [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.15 (1.01‐1.32), p = 0.04]. Among patients with elevated LDL (486 intervention, 324 control), there was decreased time to LDL goal in the intervention group [aHR 1.26 (0.99‐1.62)]. However, overall there were no significant differences between study arms in time spent at LDL or HbA1c goal. Follow‐up safety monitoring (e.g., creatinine, potassium, or transaminases) was relatively infrequent (ranging from 7 % to 29 % at 4 weeks) and not statistically different between arms. Intervention physicians indicated that lack of reimbursement for non‐visit‐based care was a barrier to use of the tool. CONCLUSIONS: A health IT tool to support between‐visit laboratory monitoring improved the LDL testing interval but not LDL or HbA1c control, and it did not alter safety monitoring. Adoption of innovative tools to support physicians in non‐visit‐based chronic disease management may be limited by current visit‐based financial and productivity incentives.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether provision of fixed dose combination treatment improves adherence and risk factor control compared with usual care of patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease in primary care. DESIGN: Open label randomised control trial: IMPACT (IMProving Adherence using Combination Therapy). SETTING: 54 general practices in the Auckland and Waikato regions of New Zealand, July 2010 to August 2013. PARTICIPANTS: 513 adults (including 257 indigenous Māori) at high risk of cardiovascular disease (established cardiovascular disease or five year risk ≥ 15%) who were recommended for treatment with antiplatelet, statin, and two or more blood pressure lowering drugs. 497 (97%) completed 12 months' follow‐up. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to continued usual care or to fixed dose combination treatment (with two versions available: aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, and lisinopril 10 mg with either atenolol 50 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg). All drugs in both treatment arms were prescribed by their usual general practitioners and dispensed by local community pharmacists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were self reported adherence to recommended drugs (antiplatelet, statin, and two or more blood pressure lowering agents) and mean change in blood pressure and low density lipoprotein cholesterol at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Among this well treated primary care population, fixed dose combination treatment improved adherence to the combination of all recommended drugs but improvements in clinical risk factors were small and did not reach statistical significance. Acceptability was high for both general practitioners and patients, although the discontinuation rate was high. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ACTRN12606000067572. RESULTS: Adherence to all four recommended drugs was greater among fixed dose combination than usual care participants at 12 months (81% v 46%; relative risk 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.52 to 2.03, P<0.001; number needed to treat 2.9, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 3.7). Adherence for each drug type at 12 months was high in both groups but especially in the fixed dose combination group: for antiplatelet treatment it was 93% fixed dose combination v 83% usual care (P<0.001), for statin 94% v 89% (P=0.06), for combination blood pressure lowering 89% v 59% (P<0.001), and for any blood pressure lowering 96% v 91% (P=0.02). Self reported adherence was highly concordant with dispensing data (dispensing of all four recommended drugs 79% fixed dose combination v 47% usual care, relative risk 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.44 to 1.93, P<0.001). There was no statistically significant improvement in risk factor control between the fixed dose combination and usual care groups over 12 months: the difference in systolic blood pressure was ‐2.2 mm Hg (‐4.5 v ‐2.3, 95% confidence interval ‐5.6 to 1.2, P=0.21), in diastolic blood pressure ‐1.2 mm Hg (‐2.1 v ‐0.9, ‐3.2 to 0.8, P=0.22) and in low density lipoprotein cholesterol ‐0.05 mmol/L (‐0.20 v ‐0.15, ‐0.17 to 0.08, P=0.46). The number of participants with cardiovascular events or serious adverse events was similar in both treatment groups (fixed dose combination 16 v usual care 18 (P=0.73), 99 v 93 (P=0.56), respectively). Fixed dose combination treatment was discontinued in 94 participants (37%). The most commonly reported reason for discontinuation was a side effect (54/75, 72%). Overall, 89% (227/256) of fixed dose combination participants' general practitioners completed a post‐trial survey, and the fixed dose combination strategy was rated as satisfactory or very satisfactory for starting treatment (206/227, 91%), blood pressure control (180/220, 82%), cholesterol control (170/218, 78%), tolerability (181/223, 81%), and prescribing according to local guidelines (185/219, 84%). When participants were asked at 12 months how easy they found taking their prescribed drugs, most responded very easy or easy (224/246, 91% fixed dose combination v 212/246, 86% usual care, P=0.09). At 12 months the change in other lipid fractions, difference in EuroQol‐5D, and difference in barriers to adherence did not differ significantly between the treatment groups.

AB  - PURPOSE: Rural low‐income African American patients with diabetes have traditionally poorer clinical outcomes and limited access to state‐of‐the‐art diabetes care. We determined the effectiveness of a redesigned primary care model on patients' glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid level control. METHODS: In 3 purposively selected, rural, fee‐for‐service, primary care practices, African American patients with type 2 diabetes received point‐of‐care education, coaching, and medication intensification from a diabetes care management team made up of a nurse, pharmacist, and dietitian. In 5 randomly selected control practices matched for practice and patient characteristics, African American patients received usual care. Using univariate and multivariate adjusted models, we evaluated the effects of the intervention on intermediate (median 18 months) and long‐term (median 36 months) changes in glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c) levels, blood pressure, and lipid levels, as well as the proportion of patients meeting target values. RESULTS: Among 727 randomly selected rural African American diabetic patients (368 intervention, 359 control), intervention patients had a significantly greater reduction in mean hemoglobin A1c levels at intermediate (‐0.5 % vs ‐0.2%; P <.05) and long‐term (‐0.5% vs ‐0.10%; P <.005) follow‐up in univariate and multivariate models. The proportion of patients achieving a hemoglobin A1c level of less than 7.5% (68% vs 59%, P <.01) and/or a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg (69% vs 57%, P <.01) was also significantly greater in intervention practices in multivariate models. CONCLUSION: Redesigning care strategies in rural fee‐for‐service primary care practices for African American patients with established diabetes results in significantly improved glycemic control relative to usual care.

AB  - Antihypertensive drug adherence (ADA) is a mainstay in blood pressure control. Education through mobile phone short message system (SMS) text messaging could improve ADA. The authors conducted a randomized study involving 314 patients with hypertension with <6 months of antihypertensive treatment from the Preventive Health Program of 12 different primary care centers in Santiago, Chile. Patients were randomly assigned to receive or not receive SMS related to ADA and healthy lifestyle. Adherence was assessed by the self‐reported four‐item scale Morisky‐Green‐Levine questionnaire at baseline and after 6 months of follow‐up, with four of four positive questions classified as good adherence. Group comparison for adherence was performed by means of a logistic regression model, adjusting by baseline adherence, age older than 60 years, and sex. A total of 163 patients were randomized to receive and 151 to not receive SMS. After 6 months of follow‐up, ADA in the non‐SMS group decreased from 59.3% to 51.4% (P=.1). By contrast, adherence increased from 49% to 62.3% (P=.01) in the SMS group. Text messaging intervention improved ADA (risk ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.0‐1.6 [P<.05]). At 6‐month follow‐up, text messaging resulted in an increase in reporting ADA in this hypertensive Latino population. This approach could become an effective tool to overcome poor medication adherence in the community.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effectiveness of a diabetes virtual clinic to enhance diabetes in primary care by developing clinical management plans for patients with suboptimal metabolic control and/or case complexity. METHODS: A prospective study with randomized allocation to virtual clinic or usual care. Patients with Type 2 diabetes (n = 208) were recruited from six general practices in South London. The primary outcome for the study was glycaemic control, secondary outcomes included: lipids, blood pressure, weight (kg and BMI) and renal function (eGFR). Data were collected from participants' records at baseline and 12 months. We also considered process measures including therapy optimization. RESULTS: The 12‐month data show equivalence between the virtual clinic and control groups for glycaemic control with both achieving clinically significant reductions in HbA1c of 8 mmol/mol (0.6 ± 1.7%) and 10 mmol/mol (0.8 ± 1.9%), respectively (P = 0.4). The virtual clinic group showed superiority over the intervention group for blood pressure control with a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 6 ± 16 mmHg compared with an increased of 2 ± 18 mmHg in the control group (P = 0.008). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of cholesterol, weight and renal function. Process measures showed an increased level of therapy adjustment in the virtual clinic group. CONCLUSION: The virtual clinic model explored in this study showed a clinically important improvement in glycaemic control. Although this improvement was not superior to that observed in the control participants, this might be attributable to the systemic impact of the virtual clinic on the practice as a whole.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Appropriate training for community pharmacists may improve the quality of medication use. Few studies have reported the impact of such programs on medication management for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, cluster‐randomized, controlled trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients with CKD stage 3a, 3b, or 4 from 6 CKD clinics (Quebec, Canada) and their community pharmacies. INTERVENTION: Each cluster (a pharmacy and its patients) was randomly assigned to either ProFiL, a training‐and‐communication network program, or the control group. ProFiL pharmacists completed a 90‐minute interactive web‐based training program on use of medications in CKD and received a clinical guide, patients' clinical summaries, and facilitated access to the CKD clinic. OUTCOMES: Drug‐related problems (primary outcome), pharmacists' knowledge and clinical skills, and patients' clinical attributes (eg, blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin concentration). MEASUREMENTS: Drug‐related problems were evaluated the year before and after the recruitment of patients using a validated set of significant drug‐related problems, the Pharmacotherapy Assessment in Chronic Renal Disease (PAIR) criteria. Pharmacists' questionnaires were completed at baseline and after 1 year. Clinical attributes were documented at baseline and after 1 year using available information in medical charts. RESULTS: 207 community pharmacies, 494 pharmacists, and 442 patients with CKD participated. After 1 year, the mean number of drug‐related problems per patient decreased from 2.16 to 1.60 and from 1.70 to 1.62 in the ProFiL and control groups, respectively. The difference in reduction of drug‐related problems per patient between the ProFiL and control groups was ‐0.32 (95% CI, ‐0.63 to ‐0.01). Improvements in knowledge (difference, 4.5%; 95% CI, 1.6%‐7.4%) and clinical competencies (difference, 7.4%; 95% CI, 3.5%‐11.3%) were observed among ProFiL pharmacists. No significant differences in clinical attributes were observed across the groups. LIMITATIONS: High proportion of missing data on knowledge and clinical skills questionnaire (34.6%) and clinical attributes (11.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Providing community pharmacists with essential clinical data, appropriate training, and support from hospital pharmacists with expertise in nephrology increases pharmacists' knowledge and reduces drug‐related problems in patients with CKD who are followed up in clinics incorporating a multidisciplinary health care team.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are significant, but often preventable, contributors to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Medication and behavioral nonadherence are significant barriers to successful hypertension, hyperlidemia, and diabetes management. Our objective was to describe the theoretical framework underlying a tailored behavioral and educational pharmacist‐administered intervention for achieving CVD risk reduction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults with poorly controlled hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia were enrolled from three outpatient primary care clinics associated with the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Durham, NC). Participants were randomly assigned to receive a pharmacist‐administered, tailored, 1‐year telephone‐based intervention or usual care. The goal of the study was to reduce the risk for CVD through a theory‐driven intervention to increase medication adherence and improve health behaviors. RESULTS: Enrollment began in November 2011 and is ongoing. The target sample size is 500 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) intervention has been designed with a strong theoretical underpinning. The theoretical foundation and intervention are designed to encourage patients with multiple comorbidities and poorly controlled CVD risk factors to engage in home‐based monitoring and tailored telephone‐based interventions. Evidence suggests that clinical pharmacist‐administered telephone‐based interventions may be efficiently integrated into primary care for patients with poorly controlled CVD risk factors.

AB  - Background Pulmonary hypertension is a rare, chronic and life‐threatening group of diseases. Recent advances in pulmonary hypertension management prolong survival and improve quality‐of‐life. However, highly complex drug therapy enhances the risk of drug‐related problems. Objective To assess the impact of involving clinical pharmacists in the collaborative care of pulmonary hypertension patients. Setting Ten French University Hospital Pneumology departments, all members of the French Network for Pulmonary Hypertension. Methods This prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial included incident pulmonary hypertension patients who were followed‐up for 18 months. Randomization using an adapted Zelen method allocated patients to collaborative care (n = 41) or usual care groups (n = 51). A collaborative care program involving clinical pharmacists was developed through a close partnership between with physicians, nurses and pharmacists. Besides usual care, the program includes regular one‐to‐one interviews between the pharmacist and the patient. These interviews had following objectives: to perform an exhaustive medication history review; to identify the patient' needs, knowledge and skills; to define educational objectives and to provide patients with relevant information when needed. Following each interview, a standardized report form containing the pharmacist's recommendations was provided to physicians and nurses and discussed collaboratively. An ancillary economic analysis was performed. Main outcome measure Number of drug‐related problems and their outcomes. Results The number of drug‐related problems was not significantly different between groups (1.6 ± 1.5 vs. 1.9 ± 2.4; p = 0.41). More problems were resolved in the collaborative care group than in the usual care group (86.5% vs. 66.7%, p = 0.01). Time to clinical worsening, therapeutic adherence, satisfaction or quality‐of‐life were not statistically different between groups. Collaborative care decreased costs of drug‐related hospitalizations. Conclusion Including clinical pharmacists in the multidisciplinary care of hospitalized patients with pulmonary hypertension improved the outcome of drug‐related problems and reduced the costs of related hospitalization. However, we observed no efficacy on medication errors, clinical outcomes or medication adherence. Clinical Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01038284.

PATIENTS: A total of 160 people who visited the two community pharmacies between September 2009 and June 2010. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized into two groups: intervention (82 patients) and control (78 patients) groups. The clinical pharmacist conducted a baseline assessment MMR for patients in both groups to determine the prevalence and type of TRPs; however, recommendations regarding the identified TRPs were only submitted to the physicians of patients in the intervention group. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients were followed for an average of 3.39 months after their baseline visit to the pharmacy. The impact of the MMR service for the intervention group was assessed by evaluating the outcomes of the recommendations submitted by the clinical pharmacist to resolve the identified TRPs, physicians' acceptance of the recommended interventions, and the effect of the intervention on certain clinical outcomes: blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and triglyceride levels. Follow‐up assessment of the control group included evaluating the outcomes of the identified TRPs (identified and corrected by physicians without any input from the clinical pharmacist) and comparing glucose level, blood pressure, and triglyceride‐level results with baseline values. No significant differences in mean number of medical conditions (3.7 vs 3.42, p=0.134), mean number of medications (4.51 vs 4.96, p=0.135), or mean number of TRPs per patient (5.55 vs 5.17, p=0.42) were observed at baseline in the intervention group versus the control group. Follow‐up results revealed a high acceptance rate of recommendations by the physicians (94%). Regarding outcomes of TRPs, almost 70% of the identified TRPs in the intervention group were resolved or improved compared with 2% in the control group (p<0.001). Significant differences were found between the intervention group versus control group with regard to mean ± SD glucose levels (99.08 ± 9.66 vs 115.48 ± 17.34, p<0.001), blood pressure (110.36/81.55 ± 9.45/3.91 vs 125.0/88.73 ± 10.34/4.12, p<0.001), and triglyceride levels (148.53 ± 15.98 vs 170.74 ± 6.26, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: The MMR service resulted in a significantly lower number of TRPs and significantly improved clinical outcomes, and it was highly accepted by the physicians.

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: With the increasing prevalence of diabetes, the physician‐centred model is challenged to deliver holistic care in Asia. Diabetes may be managed effectively within a multidisciplinary collaborative care model; however, evidence on its effectiveness in Asian patients is lacking. Therefore, the primary objective was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of multidisciplinary collaborative care vs physician‐centred care in diabetes. The secondary objectives were to evaluate humanistic and economic outcomes among the two types of care. METHODS: This 6‐month prospective, open‐label, parallel‐arm, randomized, controlled study was conducted at four outpatient healthcare institutions. High‐risk patients aged ≥21 years with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, polypharmacy and comorbidities were included. Patients with type 1 diabetes or those who were unable to communicate independently were excluded. The control arm received usual care with referrals to nurses and dietitians as needed. The intervention arm (multidisciplinary collaborative care) was followed up with pharmacists regularly, in addition to receiving the usual care. The primary outcomes included HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, low‐density lipoprotein and triglycerides. The secondary outcomes included scores from the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) and the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaires (DTSQ), and diabetes‐related health service utilization rates and costs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of 411 eligible patients, 214 and 197 patients were randomized into the intervention and control arms, respectively. At 6 months, 141 patients in the intervention arm (65.9%) and 189 patients in the control arm (95.9%) completed the study. Mean HbA1c reduced from 8.6%±1.5% at baseline to 8.1%±1.3% at 6 months in the intervention arm (P=.04), with up to mean HbA1c improvement of 0.8% in patients with greater levels of uncontrolled glycemia. Whereas the mean HbA1c in the control arm remained unchanged (8.5%±1.4%) throughout the 6‐month period. Improvements in PAID and DTSQ scores, reduction in physician workload and an average cost savings of US$91.01 per patient were observed in the intervention arm over 6 months. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: The positive clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes highlighted the value of multidisciplinary collaborative care for Asian diabetic patients, thereby supporting the effectiveness of this approach in managing chronic diseases.

AB  - Importance: Complex medication regimens pose self‐management challenges, particularly among populations with low levels of health literacy. Objective: To test medication management tools delivered through a commercial electronic health record (EHR) with and without a nurse‐led education intervention. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 3‐group cluster randomized clinical trial was performed in community health centers in Chicago, Illinois. Participants included 794 patients with hypertension who self‐reported using 3 or more medications concurrently (for any purpose). Data were collected from April 30, 2012, through February 29, 2016, and analyzed by intention to treat. Interventions: Clinics were randomly assigned to to groups: electronic health record‐based medication management tools (medication review sheets at visit check‐in, lay medication information sheets printed after visits; EHR‐alone group), EHR‐based tools plus nurse‐led medication management support (EHR plus education group), or usual care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes at 12 months included systolic blood pressure (primary outcome), medication reconciliation, knowledge of drug indications, understanding of medication instructions and dosing, and self‐reported medication adherence. Medication outcomes were assessed for all hypertension prescriptions, all prescriptions to treat chronic disease, and all medications. Results: Among the 794 participants (68.6% women; mean [SD] age, 52.7 [9.6] years), systolic blood pressure at 12 months was greater in the EHR‐alone group compared with the usual care group by 3.6 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.3 to 6.9 mm Hg). Systolic blood pressure in the EHR plus education group was not significantly lower compared with the usual care group (difference, ‐2.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, ‐5.2 to 1.3 mm Hg) but was lower compared with the EHR‐alone group (‐5.6 mm Hg; 95% CI, ‐8.8 to ‐2.4 mm Hg). At 12 months, hypertension medication reconciliation was improved in the EHR‐alone group (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.9) and the EHR plus education group (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.3) compared with usual care. Understanding of medication instructions and dosing was greater in the EHR plus education group than the usual care group for hypertension medications (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.8) and all medications combined (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.8). Compared with usual care, the EHR tools alone and EHR plus education interventions did not improve hypertension medication adherence (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6‐1.4 for both) or knowledge of chronic drug indications (OR for EHR tools alone, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.5] and OR for EHR plus education, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.7‐1.7]). Conclusions and Relevance: The study found that EHR tools in isolation improved medication reconciliation but worsened blood pressure. Combining these tools with nurse‐led support suggested improved understanding of medication instructions and dosing but did not lower blood pressure compared with usual care.

AB  - Importance: Hypertension and carotid stenosis are both risk factors for stroke, but the presence of carotid stenosis might dampen enthusiasm for tight control of hypertension because of concerns for hypoperfusion. Objective: To determine the extent to which there are opportunities to potentially improve pharmacotherapy for hypertension in patients known to have asymptomatic high‐grade carotid stenosis. Design: We examined anti‐hypertensive medication prescription and adherence to evidence‐based hypertension treatment guidelines in a cross‐sectional analysis of baseline data of patients enrolled in a clinical trial. Setting: The Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial (CREST‐2) is a multicenter prospective randomized open blinded end‐point clinical trial of intensive medical management with or without revascularization by endarterectomy or stenting for asymptomatic high‐grade carotid stenosis. Participants: 1479 participants (38.6% female; mean age 69.8 years) from 132 clinical centers enrolled in the CREST‐2 trial as of April 6, 2020 who were taking ≥1 antihypertensive drug at baseline. Exposures: Pharmacotherapy for hypertension. Main outcome: Adherence to evidence‐based guidelines for treating hypertension. Results: Of 1458 participants with complete data, 26% were on one, 31% on 2, and 43% on ≥3 antihypertensive medications at trial entry. Thirty‐two percent of participants were prescribed thiazide; 74%, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB); 38%, calcium channel blocker (CCB); 56%, a beta blocker; 11%, loop diuretic; and 27%, other. Of those prescribed a single antihypertensive medication, the proportion prescribed thiazide was 5%; ACEI or ARB, 55%, and CCB, 11%. The prevalence of guideline‐adherent regimens was 34% (95% CI, 31‐36%). Conclusions and relevance: In a diverse cohort with severe carotid disease and hypertension, non‐adherence to hypertension guidelines was common. All preferred classes of antihypertensive drug were under‐prescribed. Using staged iterative guideline‐based care for hypertension, CREST‐2 will characterize drug tolerance and stroke rates under these conditions.

AB  - Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and death worldwide. Advances in technology have added telemedicine as a tool for managing hypertension. The effectiveness of telemedicine depends on patients' ability to adhere to schedules of home monitoring and case management. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension in the intervention arm of a randomized trial who completed 6 months of follow‐up were included in this analysis. They were asked to measure their blood pressure (BP) a minimum of 6 times per week using a telemonitor that transmitted the readings to their pharmacist case manager. Hypertensive patients in this study had high adherence to telemonitoring (73% took at least 6 BP readings per week) and phone visits (88% of expected visits were attended). In a multivariate analysis, older age, male sex, and some college education predicted better telemonitoring adherence. White non‐Hispanic race/ethnicity predicted better adherence to phone visits with pharmacist case managers. Telemonitoring adherence and phone adherence were highly correlated; participants who did not send readings on schedule were more likely to skip at least one phone visit with their pharmacist case manager. The findings from this analysis indicate that hypertensive patients in this study were able to achieve and maintain high adherence to both the telemonitoring and the phone case management visits.

AB  - Effective interventions to identify and treat uncontrolled hypertension (HTN), particularly in underrepresented populations that use the emergency department (ED) for primary care, are critically needed. Uncontrolled HTN contributes significantly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is more frequently encountered among patients presenting to the ED as compared to the primary care setting. EDs serve as the point of entry into the health care system for high‐risk patient populations, including minority and low‐income patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of uncontrolled/undiagnosed HTN in patients presenting to the ED is alarmingly high. Thus ED engagement and early risk assessment/stratification is a feasible innovation to help close health disparity gaps in HTN. A Hypertension Emergency Department Intervention Aimed at Decreasing Disparities (AHEAD2) trial, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is a three‐arm single site randomized clinical pilot trial of adults presenting to the ED with Stage 2 hypertension (blood pressure [BP]>160/100) comparing (1) an ED‐initiated Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral for Treatment (SBIRT) focused on HTN, (2) the same ED‐initiated SBIRT coupled with a Post‐Acute Care Hypertension Transition Consultation by ED Clinical Pharmacists, and (3) usual care. The primary outcome is mean BP differences between study arms. Secondary outcomes are proportion of participants with BP control (BP<140/90mmHg), and improvements in HTN knowledge and medication adherence scores between study arms. The objective of this report is to describe the development of the AHEAD2 trial, including the methods, research infrastructure, and other features of the randomized clinical trial design.

AB  - AIM: To determine the impact of adding pharmacists to primary care teams on predicted 10‐year risk of cardiovascular events in patients with Type 2 diabetes without established cardiovascular disease. METHODS: This was a pre‐specified secondary analysis of randomized trial data. The main study found that, compared with usual care, addition of a pharmacist resulted in improvements in blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, and hyperglycaemia for primary care patients with Type 2 diabetes. In this sub‐study, predicted 10‐year risk of cardiovascular events at baseline and 1 year were calculated for patients free of cardiovascular disease at enrolment. The primary outcome was change in UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk score; change in Framingham risk score was a secondary outcome. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between the 102 intervention patients and 93 control subjects: 59% women, median (interquartile range) age 57 (50‐64) years, diabetes duration 3 (1‐6.5) years, systolic blood pressure 128 (120‐140) mmHg, total cholesterol 4.34 (3.75‐5.04) mmol/l and HbA(1c) 54 mmol/mol (48‐64 mmol/mol) [7.1% (6.5‐8.0%)]. Median baseline UKPDS risk score was 10.2% (6.0‐16.7%) for intervention patients and 9.5% (5.8‐15.1%) for control subjects (P = 0.80). One‐year post‐randomization, the median absolute reduction in UKPDS risk score was 1.0% greater for intervention patients compared with control subjects (P = 0.032). Similar changes were seen with the Framingham risk score (median reduction 1.2% greater for intervention patients compared with control subjects, P = 0.048). The two risk scores were highly correlated (rho = 0.83; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Adding pharmacists to primary care teams for 1 year significantly reduced the predicted 10‐year risk of cardiovascular events for patients with Type 2 diabetes without established cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Team‐based care can improve hypertension control. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate blood pressure (BP) control 18 months following the discontinuation of a physician‐pharmacist collaborative intervention. This was a retrospective analysis of patients who had previously participated in a prospective, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial. Six community‐based family medicine offices were randomized to control or intervention groups. Research nurses measured BPs using an automated device during the prospective trial. The research nurses then abstracted data from medical records, including BPs, medications, changes in therapy, and laboratory values for 18 months following the discontinuation of the 6‐month prospective trial. The study included 228 patients in the control (n = 146) or intervention (n = 82) groups. The control group contained more patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (P < .013), were older (P = .047), and had more coexisting conditions (P < .001) than the intervention group. Systolic BP 9 months following discontinuation of the physician‐pharmacist intervention was 137.2 ± 18.2 mm Hg and 129.8 ± 13.3 mm Hg in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = .0015). BP control was maintained in 61 (41.8%) control patients and 55 (67.1%) intervention patients (P = .0003). At 18 months post‐intervention, systolic BP was 138.1 ± 20.4 mm Hg and 130.0 ± 16.0 mm Hg in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = .023). BP control was maintained in 53 (36.3%) control patients and 55 (67.1%) intervention patients at 18 months post‐intervention (P < .0001). A sensitivity analysis was conducted to address the uneven distribution of patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, and the differences between groups were still significant. BP control rates remained significantly higher following a physician‐pharmacist intervention compared with usual care for 18 months after discontinuation of the intervention. This model has the potential value as a useful long‐term strategy to benefit patients with hypertension.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate that pharmacists working with physicians and other providers in an ambulatory care setting can improve glucose, blood pressure, and lipid control for patients with type 2 diabetes and to report patient adherence to screening and general preventive measures. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, clinical practice study. SETTING: Burlington, MA, between January 2001 and August 2003. PATIENTS: 164 patients patients with type 2 diabetes older than 18 years with glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) greater than 8%. INTERVENTION: Pharmacist‐patient clinic visits included obtaining a comprehensive medication review; performing targeted physical assessment; ordering laboratory tests; reviewing, modifying, and monitoring patients' medication therapy and providing detailed counseling on all therapies; facilitating self‐monitoring of blood glucose; and providing reinforcement of dietary guidelines and exercise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Effect of clinical pharmacists working with physicians in an ambulatory setting on health measures (e.g., A1C, blood pressure, cholesterol) of patients with diabetes. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. After 1 year, significant improvements occurred for A1C and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the intervention group compared with the control group (A1C, 7.7% vs. 8.4%; LDL, 93.7 vs. 105.1 mg/dL; P < 0.05). Systolic blood pressure improved for all study patients without a difference between the two groups. Diastolic blood pressure improved significantly in the intervention group compared with the control group (73.4 mm Hg vs. 77.6 mm Hg, P < 0.05). Significantly more intervention patients were screened for retinopathy, neuropathy, and microalbuminuria than control patients ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: For all indices measured, this study demonstrated that collaborative diabetes management with a clinical pharmacist can improve overall care.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Pay for performance is intended to align incentives to promote high‐quality care, but results have been contradictory. OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of explicit financial incentives to reward guideline‐recommended hypertension care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized trial of 12 Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics with 5 performance periods and a 12‐month washout that enrolled 83 primary care physicians and 42 nonphysician personnel (eg, nurses, pharmacists). INTERVENTIONS: Physician‐level (individual) incentives, practice‐level incentives, both, or none. Intervention participants received up to 5 payments every 4 months; all participants could access feedback reports. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Among a random sample, number of patients achieving guideline‐recommended blood pressure thresholds or receiving an appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure, number of patients prescribed guideline‐recommended medications, and number who developed hypotension. RESULTS: Mean (SD) total payments over the study were $4270 ($459), $2672 ($153), and $1648 ($248) for the combined, individual, and practice‐level interventions, respectively. The unadjusted baseline and final percentages and the adjusted absolute change over the study in patients meeting the combined blood pressure/appropriate response measure were 75% to 84% and 8.84% (95% CI, 4.20% to 11.80%) for the individual group, 80% to 85% and 3.70% (95% CI, 0.24% to 7.68%) for the practice‐level group, 79% to 88% and 5.54% (95% CI, 1.92% to 9.52%) for the combined group, and 86% to 86% and 0.47% (95% CI, ‐3.12% to 4.04%) for the control group. The adjusted absolute estimated difference in the change between the proportion of patients with blood pressure control/appropriate response for individual incentive and control groups was 8.36% (95% CI, 2.40% to 13.00%; P=.005). The other incentive groups did not show a significant change compared with controls for this outcome. For medications, the unadjusted baseline and final percentages and the adjusted absolute change were 61% to 73% and 9.07% (95% CI, 4.52% to 13.44%), 56% to 65% and 4.98% (95% CI, 0.64% to 10.08%), 65% to 80% and 7.26% (95% CI, 2.92% to 12.48%), and 63% to 72% and 4.35% (95% CI, ‐0.28% to 9.28%), respectively. These changes in the use of guideline‐recommended medications were not significant in any of the incentive groups compared with controls, nor was the incidence of hypotension. The effect of the incentive was not sustained after a washout. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Individual financial incentives, but not practice‐level or combined incentives, resulted in greater blood pressure control or appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure; none of the incentives resulted in greater use of guideline‐recommended medications or increased incidence of hypotension compared with controls. Further research is needed on the factors that contributed to these findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00302718.

T2  - Pharmacotherapy
AB  - Study Objective: To evaluate whether a simple pharmacist protocol, consisting of patient screening and cardiovascular risk stratification, identification and reminders about uncontrolled risk factors, and drug adherence support, can significantly reduce cardiovascular risk. Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled pilot study. Setting. Large primary care medical clinic in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Patients: One hundred seventy‐six adult patients (mean age 60 yrs) who exhibited a 10‐year Framingham risk score of 15% or greater, or a coronary artery disease risk equivalent (coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or diabetes mellitus). Intervention: Eligible patients initially met with the pharmacist to receive general counselling about cardiovascular disease and were then randomly assigned to receive ongoing follow‐up by the pharmacist (follow‐up group [88 patients]) or to return to usual care (single‐contact group [88 patients]) for a minimum of 6 months. Measurements and Main Results: The primary end point was mean reduction in the 10‐year Framingham risk score. Secondary end points included individual modifiable risk factors (systolic and diastolic blood pressures; total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL], and triglyceride levels; total cholesterol:HDL ratio; and hemoglobin A1c value), as well as statin utilization, initiation, and adherence rates. Baseline characteristics were similar across both groups. Neither the mean reduction in 10‐year risk (‐2.68 for the follow‐up group and ‐1.25 for the single‐contact group, one‐tailed p=0.098) nor individual risk factors were significantly different between groups. The proportion of patients exhibiting statin adherence of 80% or greater did not significantly differ between groups at study end (73.1% [57/78] and 80.0% [52/65], respectively, p=0.333). However, 85.2% (75/88) in the follow‐up group continued with statin therapy at the end of the study compared with 67.0% (59/88) in the single‐contact group (p=0.005). Statin initiations were more frequent in the follow‐up group than in the single‐contact group (75.0% [30/40) vs 48.9% [22/45], p=0.013). Conclusion: This simple cardiovascular care protocol for nonspecialist pharmacists did not result in a clear improvement to cardiovascular risk reduction success among patients in a primary care medical clinic. The intervention did, however, appear to improve statin utilization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study explored the impact of MTM service on MMD patients with hypertension. METHODS: A total of 120 MMD inpatients from September to November 2019 were received and randomly divided into intervention group and control group. General services for noninfectious chronic diseases were given to the control group, while a standard MTM service was given to the intervention group. Patients' blood pressure, EQ‐5D utility value, readmission rate, drug‐related problems, and average daily medication therapy cost were compared between the two groups and within the groups. This was done at the initial admission phase and in the first, third, sixth, and twelfth months after discharge. RESULTS: The intervention group had significantly lower blood pressure and average daily medication therapy cost 12 months after discharge compared to the control group (systolic blood pressure: P = 0.023, diastolic blood pressure: P < 0.001, average daily medication therapy cost: P = 0.049); the number of DRPs decreased in both groups 12 months after discharge; the number of DRPs solved in the intervention group in the third, sixth and twelfth months after discharge were statistically higher compared with that in the control group (P = 0.013, P = 0.012, P = 0.001); there was no significant difference in the EQ‐5D utility value and readmission rate between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MTM implementation in MMD patients can improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare‐related costs among MMD patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a program of cooperation between physician and pharmacist to reduce cardiovascular risk factors in patients with mild to moderate hypertension by promoting better blood pressure (BP) control, appropriate changes in antihypertensive medications, and beneficial changes in lifestyle. METHODS: The 132 subjects in this randomized, controlled trial were in the age range of 40‐79 years. The inclusion criteria were: systolic BP (SBP) ranging from 140‐179 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ranging from 90‐99 mm Hg and treatment‐naive (untreated for hypertension); or on a regimen of medication for hypertension. Of these 132 subjects, 124 (94%) were already receiving treatment with antihypertensive medications. Equal numbers of subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a physician‐pharmacist intervention group (n = 66) and a control group (n = 66). RESULTS: The 6‐month follow‐up rate was 97% in both groups. At 6 months, the mean decrease in SBP/DBP, as measured at home in the morning, was 2.9/3.3 mm Hg in the intervention group relative to baseline (P = 0.02 and P < 0.0001 for SBP and DBP, respectively). The mean decrease in home morning SBP in the intervention group was not significantly greater than in the control group. However, the DBP decline was significantly greater in the intervention than control groups, which showed a mean decrease of 2.8 mm Hg (confidence interval: ‐5.5 to ‐0.1; P = 0.04). The percentage of patients in whom control of home morning BP was achieved was 53% in the intervention group and 47% in the control group (P = 0.40). A higher percentage of patients in the intervention group, relative to the control group, were able to reduce the use of antihypertensive medications (31 vs. 8%, P < 0.0001), and fewer patients in this group required additional medications or increases in dosage relative to the controls (11 vs. 28%, P = 0.03). Patients of the intervention group were more likely to show reduction in body mass index and sodium intake and to stop smoking, as compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A program of cooperation between physician and pharmacist was successful in reducing cardiovascular risk factors in patients with mild to moderate hypertension by promoting better blood pressure (BP) control, appropriate changes in antihypertensive medications, and beneficial changes in lifestyle.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In patients with hypertension, medication adherence is often suboptimal, thereby increasing the risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke. In a randomized trial, we investigated the effectiveness of a multifaceted pharmacist intervention in a hospital setting to improve medication adherence in hypertensive patients. Motivational interviewing was a key element of the intervention. METHODS: Patients (n = 532) were recruited from 3 hospital outpatient clinics and randomized to usual care or a 6‐month pharmacist intervention comprising collaborative care, medication review, and tailored adherence counseling including motivational interviewing and telephone follow‐ups. The primary outcome was composite medication possession ratio (MPR) to antihypertensive and lipid‐lowering agents, at 1‐year follow‐up, assessed by analyzing pharmacy records. Secondary outcomes at 12 months included persistence to medications, blood pressure, hospital admission, and a combined clinical endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke, or acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS: At 12 months, 20.3% of the patients in the intervention group (n = 231) were nonadherent (MPR <0.80), compared with 30.2% in the control group (n = 285) (risk difference ‐9.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], ‐17.3, ‐2.4) and median MPR (interquartile range) was 0.93 (0.82‐0.99) and 0.91 (0.76‐0.98), respectively, P = .02. The combined clinical endpoint was reached by 1.3% in the intervention group and 3.1% in the control group (relative risk 0.41; 95% CI, 0.11‐1.50). No significant differences were found for persistence, blood pressure, or hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted pharmacist intervention in a hospital setting led to a sustained improvement in medication adherence for patients with hypertension. The intervention had no significant impact on blood pressure and secondary clinical outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients experience barriers that make it difficult to take cardiovascular disease (CVD)‐related medications as prescribed. The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) was a tailored behavioral pharmacist‐administered and telephone‐based intervention for reducing CVD risk. OBJECTIVES: To (a) describe patient‐reported barriers to taking their medication as prescribed and (b) evaluate patient‐level characteristics associated with reporting medication barriers. METHODS: We recruited patients receiving care at primary care clinics affiliated with Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Eligible patients were diagnosed with hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia that were poorly controlled (blood pressure of > 150/100 mmHg and/or low‐density lipoprotein value > 130 mg/dL). At the time of enrollment, patients completed an interview with 7 questions derived from a validated medication barriers measure. Patient characteristics and individual medication treatment barriers are described. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the association between a medication barrier score and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Most patients (n = 428) were married or living with their partners (57%) and were men (85%) who were diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia (64%). The most commonly reported barriers were having too much medication to take (31%) and forgetting whether medication was taken at a particular time (24%). In adjusted analysis, those who were not employed (1.32, 95% CI = 0.50‐2.14) or did not have someone to help with tasks, if needed (1.66, 95% CI = 0.42‐2.89), reported higher medication barrier scores. Compared with those diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, those with only hypertension (0.91, 95% CI = 0.04‐1.79) reported higher medication barrier scores. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to medication adherence are common. Evaluating and addressing barriers may increase medication adherence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient adherence is necessary for successful medication therapy. However, highly complex medication regimens may lead to poor adherence, which decreases the effectiveness of treatment and often results in treatment failure, excessive morbidity and mortality, and higher costs.  OBJECTIVE: To examine whether patient adherence can be increased indirectly through reducing medication complexity by (a) pharmaceutical counseling of hospital medical staff and (b) additional information in the discharge letter for the primary care provider (PCP) about the simplified discharge medication.  METHODS: At the Medical Center Hamburg‐Eppendorf, a tertiary care university hospital in Germany, 240 chronically ill inpatients with hypertension, diabetes, and/or dyslipidemia were enrolled in this prospective, semirandomized study. For the intervention group, hospital doctors were counseled by a clinical pharmacist on feasible simplifications of cardiovascular and antidiabetic medications. In 1 randomized subgroup, the PCP received additional explanatory information in the discharge letter. Adherence (self‐reporting using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale [MARS‐D]) and medication complexity (using the Medication Regimen Complexity Index [MRCI‐D]) were recorded at admission to the hospital, discharge from the hospital, and 6 weeks after discharge. Patient quality of life (QoL) and satisfaction with information about medications were assessed at admission and after discharge.   RESULTS: At discharge, the medication regimen in the intervention group was significantly less complex than in the comparison group. Yet, 6 weeks  after discharge, the complexity of the outpatient medication had increased to values similar to the comparison group, unless the PCP received additional information in the discharge letter. Propensity adjusted complete adherence rates at discharge were slightly, but not significantly, higher in the intervention group than in the comparison group. Within the intervention group, complete adherence was more frequent in the subgroup with additional information for the PCP. Patient QoL and satisfaction with information were comparable in both groups.   CONCLUSION: The complexity of cardiovascular and antidiabetic hospital medications can be reduced by counseling the hospital doctors. However, for a sustainable simplification of outpatient medication, the PCPs must receive explicit information about the modifications. Patient adherence was not significantly influenced by this intervention. To verify these results, further research with objective measures of adherence and in patients with other diseases is needed.

AB  - Team‐based care has been recommended for patients with treatment‐resistant hypertension (TRH), but its efficacy in this setting is unknown. We compared a physician‐pharmacist collaborative model (PPCM) to usual care in patients with TRH participating in the Collaboration Among Pharmacists and Physicians To Improve Outcomes Now study. At baseline, 169 patients (27% of Collaboration Among Pharmacists and Physicians To Improve Outcomes Now patients) had TRH: 111 received the PPCM intervention and 58 received usual care. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment arms. After 9 months, adjusted mean systolic blood pressure was reduced by 7 mm Hg more with PPCM intervention than usual care (P = .036). Blood pressure control was 34.2% with PPCM versus 25.9% with usual care (adjusted odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.33‐11.2). These findings suggest that team‐based care in the primary care setting may be effective for TRH. Additional research is needed regarding the long‐term impact of these models and to identify patients most likely to benefit from team‐based interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with hypertension continue to have less than optimal blood pressure control, with nearly one in five Canadian adults having hypertension. Pharmacist prescribing is gaining favor as a potential clinically efficacious and cost‐effective means to improve both access and quality of care. With Alberta being the first province in Canada to have independent prescribing by pharmacists, it offers a unique opportunity to evaluate outcomes in patients who are prescribed antihypertensive therapy by pharmacists. METHODS: The study is a randomized controlled trial of enhanced pharmacist care, with the unit of randomization being the patient. Participants will be randomized to enhanced pharmacist care (patient identification, assessment, education, close follow‐up, and prescribing/titration of antihypertensive medications) or usual care. Participants are patients in rural Alberta with undiagnosed/uncontrolled blood pressure, as defined by the Canadian Hypertension Education Program. The primary outcome is the change in systolic blood pressure between baseline and 24 weeks in the enhanced‐care versus usual‐care arms. There are also three substudies running in conjunction with the project examining different remuneration models, investigating patient knowledge, and assessing health‐resource utilization amongst patients in each group. DISCUSSION: To date, one‐third of the required sample size has been recruited. There are 15 communities and 17 pharmacists actively screening, recruiting, and following patients. This study will provide high‐level evidence regarding pharmacist prescribing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00878566.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is poorly controlled. Team‐based care and changes in the process of care have been proposed to address these quality problems. However, assessing care processes is difficult because they are often confounded even in randomized behavioral studies by unmeasured confounders based on discretion of health care providers. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of process measures including number of counseling sessions about lifestyle modification and number of antihypertensive medications on blood pressure change and payer‐perspective treatment costs. METHODS: Data were obtained from two prospective, cluster randomized controlled clinical trials (Trial A and B) implementing physician‐pharmacist collaborative interventions compared with usual care over six months in community‐based medical offices in the Midwest. Multivariate linear regression models with both instrumental variable methods and as‐treated methods were utilized. Instruments were indicators for trial and study arms. Models of blood pressure change and costs included both process measures, demographic variables, and clinical variables. RESULTS: The analysis included 496 subjects. As‐treated methods showed no significant associations between process and outcomes. The instruments used in the study were insufficient to simultaneously identify distinct process effects. However, the post‐hoc instrumental variable models including one process measure at a time while controlling for the other process demonstrated significant associations between the processes and outcomes with estimates considerably larger than as‐treated estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Instrumental variable methods with combined randomized behavioral studies may be useful to evaluate the effects of different care processes. However, substantial distinct process variation across studies is needed to fully capitalize on this approach. Instrumental variable methods focusing on individual processes provided larger and stronger outcome relationships than those found using as‐treated methods which are subject to confounding.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a community‐based, pharmacist‐directed diabetes management program among managed care organization enrollees using National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)‐Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) performance measures. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Regional community pharmacy chain in Tulsa, OK, from November 2005 to July 2007. PATIENTS: 52 participants with diabetes and hypertension who were enrolled in a managed care organization. INTERVENTION: Diabetes management versus standard care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comprehensive diabetes care measures of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C <7.0%), blood pressure (<130/80 mm Hg), and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (<100 mg/dL). A composite research outcome of success was created by determining whether a participant achieved two of the three HEDIS goals at the end of 9 months. RESULTS: 46.7% of intervention group participants achieved the A1C goal, while 9.1% of control group participants achieved the goal ( P < 0.002). More than one‐half (53.3%) of intervention participants achieved the blood pressure goal compared with 22.7% of control participants ( P < 0.02). Among control group participants, 50% achieved the LDL cholesterol goal compared with 46.67% of intervention group participants. The odds of the intervention group attaining the composite goal were 5.87 times greater than the control group. CONCLUSION: A community pharmacy‐based diabetes management program was effective in achieving A1C and blood pressure goals measured by NCQA‐HEDIS performance standards. Program participants were statistically significantly more likely to achieve two of three HEDIS standards during a 9‐month period.

AB  - Objective: To estimate long‐term costs and outcomes attributable to a physician‐pharmacist collaborative intervention compared with physician management alone for treating essential hypertension. Methods: A Markov model cohort simulation with a 6‐month cycle length to predict acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and heart failure throughout lifetime was performed. A cohort of 399 patients was obtained from two prospective, cluster randomized controlled clinical trials implementing physician‐pharmacist collaborative interventions in community‐based medical offices in the Midwest, USA. Framingham risk equations and other algorithms were used to predict the vascular diseases. SBP reduction due to the interventions deteriorated until 5 years. Direct medical costs using a payer perspective were adjusted to 2015 dollar value, and the main outcome was quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs); both were discounted at 3%. The intervention costs were estimated from the trials, whereas the remaining parameters were from published studies. A series of sensitivity analyses including changing patient risks of vascular diseases, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and a cost‐effectiveness acceptability curve were performed. Results: The lifetime incremental costs were $26 807.83 per QALY (QALYs gained = 0.14). The intervention provided the greatest benefit for the high‐risk patients, moderate benefit for the trial patients, and the lowest benefit for the low‐risk patients. If a payer is willing to pay $50 000 per QALY gained, in 48.6% of the time the intervention would be cost‐effective. Conclusion: Team‐based care such as a physician‐pharmacist collaboration appears to be a cost‐effective strategy for treating hypertension. The intervention is most cost‐effective for high‐risk patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of a pharmacist in primary health care settings of Pakistan is still obscure. Thus, we aimed to demonstrate the pharmacist‐led improvements in glycemic, blood pressure and lipid controls in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients of Lahore, Pakistan. METHODS: The first open label, randomized control trial conducted at a primary health care facility of Lahore, Pakistan by enrolling 244 uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (hemoglobin A1 c, (HbA1c); 10.85 ± 1.74) patients. The pharmacological intervention included identification of drug related problems, drug interactions, change in dose, frequency and therapy switches in collaboration with physician, while non‐pharmacological intervention consisted of diet, lifestyle and behavior counseling. Outcome measures were glycemic (HbA1c), blood pressure and lipid controls. RESULTS: In intra‐group comparison, compared to control arm (C, n = 52), subjects in the intervention arm (I, n = 83) demonstrated significant differences in process outcome measures; baseline vs final, such as HbA1c (C; 10.3 ± 1.3 vs 9.7 ± 1.3, p <  0.001, I; 10.9 ± 1.7 vs 7.7 ± 0.9, p <  0.0001), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (C; 129.9 ± 13.9 vs 136 ± 7.1, p = 0.0001, I; 145 ± 20.4 vs 123.9 ± 9.9 mmHg, p <  0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (C; + 4, p = 0.03, I; ‐ 7 mmHg, p <  0.0001), cholesterol (C; 235.8 ± 57.7 vs 220.9 ± 53.2, p = 0.15, I; 224 ± 55.2 vs 153 ± 25.9 mg/dL, p < 0.0001), triglycerides (C; 213.2 ± 86.6 vs 172.4 ± 48.7, p = 0.001, I; 273 ± 119.4 vs 143 ± 31.6 mg/dL, p < 0.0001) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (C; 77.5 ± 18.6 vs 76 ± 14.2, p = 0.5, I; 69.4 ± 21.3 vs 93.8 ± 15.2 ml/min/1.73m2, p < 0.0001). Likewise, inter‐group improvements were more significant in the subjects of intervention group at final follow up in comparison to control for various process outcome measures; HbA1c (p < 0.001), SBP (p < 0.0001), DBP (p = 0.02), cholesterol (p < 0.0001), triglycerides (p < 0.0001), SCr (p < 0.001), eGFR (p < 0.001). Moreover, both male and female subjects exhibited similar responses towards intervention with similar improvements in outcome measures. CONCLUSION: These data suggested that pharmacist intervention in collaboration with physician in primary health care settings may result in significant improvements in glycemic, blood pressure and lipid controls in Pakistani population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered retrospectively with International Standard Registered Clinical/soCial sTudy Number (ISRCTN) registry on July 26, 2017 under nutritional, metabolic, endocrine category with assigned registration # ISRCTN22657497 and can be assessed at https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN22657497.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether screening for chronic kidney disease (CKD) can improve the care of persons at high risk for complications remains uncertain. We describe the design and early implementation experience of a pilot, cluster‐randomized pragmatic trial to evaluate the feasibility, implementation, and effectiveness of a "triple marker" CKD screening program (creatinine, cystatin C and albumin to creatinine ratio) for improving care among hypertensive veterans seen in primary care at one Veterans Administration Hospital. METHODS/DESIGN: Non‐diabetic hypertensive veterans age 18‐80 without known CKD were randomized in clusters determined by primary care provider (unit of randomization) into three arms. Usual care will be compared with two incrementally intensified treatment strategies: (1) screen for CKD followed by patient and provider education or (2) screen‐educate plus a clinical pharmacist‐led CKD and BP management program. The primary clinical outcome is systolic blood pressure (BP) change from baseline. Secondary clinical outcome is BP control. The primary process outcomes is triple marker screening (across three arms), and secondary process outcomes include use of inhibitors of the renin‐angiotensin system (ACE/ARB) overall and in persons with albuminuria, CKD recognition by PCP, use of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and NSAID education by PCP. The design uses the Veterans Health Administration electronic health record (EHR) to identify participants, deliver the interventions and ascertain study outcomes. Assessment of the program implementation will use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE‐AIM) framework. Study duration is 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 1,819 patients have been randomized within 41 provider clusters. The median age (interquartile range) is 68 years (61‐72), and 99% of participants are male. Approximately 16% are Black, and 5% Hispanic. In the first 6 months of the trial, 434 triple marker screening tests have been ordered, and 217(50%) have been tested. A total of 48 new CKD cases have been identified among those tested, for a preliminary yield of 22%. CONCLUSION: We have successfully implemented a pragmatic protocol that uses the EHR to identify and characterize eligible participants, deliver the intervention, and ascertain study outcomes with high rates of participation by providers and patients. Results from this study can guide design of pragmatic trials in the field of CKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01978951 ; Date or Registration: 1/17/2014.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Group medical clinics (GMCs) are widely used in the management of diabetes and hypertension, but data on their effectiveness are limited. OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of GMCs in the management of comorbid diabetes and hypertension. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00286741) SETTING: 2 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in North Carolina and Virginia. PATIENTS: 239 patients with poorly controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A(1c) [HbA(1c)] level > or =7.5%) and hypertension (systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg). INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned within each center to either attend a GMC or receive usual care. Clinics comprised 7 to 8 patients and a care team that consisted of a primary care general internist, a pharmacist, and a nurse or other certified diabetes educator. Each session included structured group interactions moderated by the educator. The pharmacist and physician adjusted medication to manage each patient's HbA(1c) level and blood pressure. MEASUREMENTS: Hemoglobin A(1c) level and systolic blood pressure, measured by blinded research personnel at baseline, study midpoint (median, 6.8 months), and study completion (median follow‐up, 12.8 months). Linear mixed models, adjusted for clustering within GMCs, were used to compare HbA(1c) levels and systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: Mean baseline systolic blood pressure and HbA(1c) level were 152.9 mm Hg (SD, 14.2) and 9.2% (SD, 1.4), respectively. At the end of the study, mean systolic blood pressure improved by 13.7 mm Hg in the GMC group and 6.4 mm Hg in the usual care group (P = 0.011 by linear mixed model), whereas mean HbA(1c) level improved by 0.8% in the GMC group and 0.5% in the usual care group (P = 0.159). LIMITATION: Measurements of effectiveness may have been limited by concomitant improvements in the usual care group that were due to co‐intervention. CONCLUSION: Group medical clinics are a potent strategy for improving blood pressure but not HbA(1c) level in diabetic patients.

We compared 2 types of case management (active prescribing by pharmacists or nurse‐led screening and feedback to primary care physicians) in addition to usual care. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial involving adults with recent minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack whose systolic blood pressure or lipid levels were above guideline targets. Participants in both groups had a monthly visit for 6 months with either a nurse or pharmacist. Nurses measured cardiovascular risk factors, counselled patients and faxed results to primary care physicians (active control). Pharmacists did all of the above as well as prescribed according to treatment algorithms (intervention). RESULTS: Most of the 279 study participants (mean age 67.6 yr, mean systolic blood pressure 134 mm Hg, mean low‐density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol 3.23 mmol/L) were already receiving treatment at baseline (antihypertensives: 78.1%; statins: 84.6%), but none met guideline targets (systolic blood pressure ≤ 140 mm Hg, fasting LDL cholesterol ≤ 2.0 mmol/L). Substantial improvements were observed in both groups after 6 months: 43.4% of participants in the pharmacist case manager group met both systolic blood pressure and LDL guideline targets compared with 30.9% in the nurse‐led group (12.5% absolute difference; number needed to treat = 8, p = 0.03). INTERPRETATION: Compared with nurse‐led case management (risk factor evaluation, counselling and feedback to primary care providers), active case management by pharmacists substantially improved risk factor control at 6 months among patients who had experienced a stroke.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Even in high‐performing health systems, some patients with diabetes mellitus have poor blood pressure (BP) control because of poor medication adherence and lack of medication intensification. We examined whether the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention, a pharmacist‐led intervention combining elements found in efficacy studies to lower BP, improved BP among patients with diabetes mellitus with persistent hypertension and poor refill adherence or insufficient medication intensification in 2 high‐performing health systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective, multisite cluster randomized pragmatic trial with randomization of 16 primary care teams at 5 medical centers (3 Veterans Affairs and 2 Kaiser Permanente) to the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention or usual care. The primary outcome was relative change in systolic BP (SBP), comparing 1797 intervention with 2303 control team patients, from 6 months preceding to 6 months after the 14‐month intervention period. We examined shorter‐term changes in SBP as a secondary outcome. The mean SBP decrease from 6 months before to 6 months after the intervention period was ≈9 mm Hg in both arms. Mean SBPs of eligible intervention patients were 2.4 mm Hg lower (95% CI: ‐3.4 to ‐1.5; P<0.001) immediately after the intervention than those achieved by control patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Adherence and Intensification of Medications program more rapidly lowered SBPs among intervention patients, but usual‐care patients achieved equally low SBP levels by 6 months after the intervention period. These findings show the importance of evaluating in different real‐life clinical settings programs found in efficacy trials to be effective before urging their widespread adoption in all settings.

AB  - Evening dosing of antihypertensive medications lowers nighttime blood pressure, and in one large randomized trial, it reduced the risk for cardiovascular outcomes. However, the feasibility of nighttime dosing in routine clinical practice is unknown. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of a brief pharmacist intervention to assign patients to take antihypertensive medications at specific times of the day. In this pilot, randomized controlled trial, 79 patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) taking one or more antihypertensive medications once daily were randomized to take one once‐daily antihypertensive either in the morning or in the evening. A total of 79 patients were randomized (39 to morning dosing, 40 to evening dosing). Average (SD) age was 56.5 (14) years, 68% were male, and average (SD) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 36.6 (8.9) mL/min/1.73m2. Adherence, defined as taking the once‐daily medication at the time indicated six or seven times in the last 7 days and not taking it at any other time during the day, was 91% in the morning arm and 95% in the evening arm (p = 0.57). This pilot demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of a pharmacist‐physician collaborative to assign once���daily antihypertensive medications to either morning or evening dosing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately half of patients with chronic cardiometabolic conditions are nonadherent with their prescribed medications. Interventions to improve adherence have been only modestly effective because they often address single barriers to adherence, intervene at single points in time, or are imprecisely targeted to patients who may not need adherence assistance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a multicomponent, behaviorally tailored pharmacist‐based intervention to improve adherence to medications for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. TRIAL DESIGN: The STIC2IT trial is a cluster‐randomized pragmatic trial testing the impact of a pharmacist‐led multicomponent intervention that uses behavioral interviewing, text messaging, mailed progress reports, and video visits. Targeted patients are those who are nonadherent to glucose‐lowering, antihypertensive, or statin medications and who also have evidence of poor disease control. The intervention is tailored to patients' individual health barriers and their level of health activation. We cluster‐randomized 14 practice sites of a large multispecialty group practice to receive either the pharmacist‐based intervention or usual care. STIC2IT has enrolled 4,076 patients who will be followed up for 12months after randomization. The trial's primary outcome is medication adherence, assessed using pharmacy claims data. Secondary outcomes are disease control and health care resource utilization. CONCLUSION: This trial will determine whether a technologically enabled, behaviorally targeted pharmacist‐based intervention results in improved adherence and disease control. If effective, this strategy could be a scalable method of offering tailored adherence support to those with the greatest clinical need.

T2  - Journal of medical Internet research
AB  - Background: A scientific, personalized, and quantitative exercise prescription that has the potential to be an important therapeutic agent for all ages in the prevention of chronic disease is highly recommended. However, it is often poorly implemented, as clinicians lack the necessary knowledge and skills while participants have low adherence due to design defects (eg, prescriptions fail to take individual willingness, the appeal of exercise, and complex physical conditions into account). Intelligent personalized prescription is thus worth exploring. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether a year‐long cloud platform‐based and intelligent personalized exercise prescription intervention could improve Chinese middle‐aged and older adult community dwellers' health outcomes. Methods: A total of 177 participants (aged 52‐85 years; mean 67.93, SD 7.05) were recruited from 2 Chinese community health service centers in Anhui Province, China. The exercise intervention was delivered over 12 months with a single‐group pretest‐posttest design. After being assessed in terms of physical activity, health‐related lifestyle, history of chronic diseases and drug use, family history of disease and cardiovascular function, body composition, bone mineral density, and physical fitness through an eHealth promotion system, participants with relative contraindications for exercise were personally prescribed the health care exercise mode by an intelligent system, while those without relative contraindication and who had a regular exercise habit were prescribed the scientific fitness mode. Paired t tests were used for the analysis. Results: A total of 97 participants were classified into the health care mode, and the remaining 80 participants were assigned to the scientific fitness mode. Significant changes in heart rate (mean difference [MD] 2.97; 95% CI 1.1‐4.84; P=.002), subendocardial viability ratio (MD ‐0.13; CI: ‐1.19 to ‐0.63; P<.001), weight (MD 0.99; CI 0.29‐1.69; P=.006), BMI (MD 0.38; CI 0.11‐0.64; P=.006), body fat rate (MD 0.88; CI 0.24‐1.51; P=.007), fat mass (MD 0.92; CI 0.33‐1.53; P=.003), and brachial‐ankle pulse wave velocity (MD: ‐0.72; CI ‐1.17 to ‐0.27; P=.002) were observed among participants with the health care mode exercise prescriptions at the 12‐month postintervention versus the baseline assessment, while no changes in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, muscle mass, bone mineral density, t value, z value, balance, or ability were discerned. The results showed a functional decline in the physical fitness of both groups, including in handgrip strength (healthcare mode: MD 4.41; scientific fitness mode: MD 3.11), vital capacity (healthcare mode: MD 261.99; scientific fitness mode: MD 250.78), and agility (healthcare mode MD=‐0.35; scientific fitness mode: MD=‐0.39) with all P values <.001, except handgrip strength in the scientific fitness mode (P=.002). There were no significant differences in other parameters among participants with scientific fitness mode exercise prescriptions. Conclusions: The observations suggest that our exercise prescription intervention program might promote certain health outcomes in Chinese middle‐aged and older adult community dwellers, yet we are unable to recommend such a program given the existing limitations. Future randomized controlled trials with diverse samples are warranted to confirm our findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood pressure (BP) is poorly controlled among a large proportion of hypertensive outpatients. Innovative models of care are therefore needed to improve BP control. The Team‐Based Care for improving Hypertension management (TBC‐HTA) study aims to evaluate the effect of a team‐based care (TBC) interprofessional intervention, involving nurses, community pharmacists and physicians, on BP control of hypertensive outpatients compared to usual care in routine clinical practice. METHODS/DESIGN: The TBC‐HTA study is a pragmatic randomized controlled study with a 6‐month follow‐up which tests a TBC interprofessionnal intervention conducted among uncontrolled treated hypertensive outpatients in two ambulatory clinics and among seven nearby community pharmacies in Lausanne and Geneva, Switzerland. A total of 110 patients are being recruited and randomized to TBC (TBC: N = 55) or usual care group (UC: N = 55). Patients allocated to the TBC group receive the TBC intervention conducted by an interprofessional team, involving an ambulatory clinic nurse, a community pharmacist and a physician. A nurse and a community pharmacist meet patients every 6 weeks to measure BP, to assess lifestyle, to estimate medication adherence, and to provide education to the patient about disease, treatment and lifestyle. After each visit, the nurse and pharmacist write a summary report with recommendations related to medication adherence, lifestyle, and changes in therapy. The physician then adjusts antihypertensive therapy accordingly. Patients in the UC group receive usual routine care without sessions with a nurse and a pharmacist. The primary outcome is the difference in daytime ambulatory BP between TBC and UC patients at 6‐month of follow‐up. Secondary outcomes include patients' and healthcare professionals' satisfaction with the TBC intervention and BP control at 12 months (6 months after the end of the intervention). DISCUSSION: This ongoing study aims to evaluate the effect of a newly developed team‐based care intervention engaging different healthcare professionals on BP control in a primary care setting in Switzerland. The results will inform policymakers on implementable strategies for routine clinical practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT02511093 .

T2  - BMC cardiovascular disorders
AB  - Background: In the treatment of coronary heart disease, secondary prevention goals are still often unmet and poor adherence to prescribed drugs has been suggested as one of the reasons. We aimed to investigate whether pharmaceutical care by a pharmacist at the cardiology clinic trained in motivational interviewing improves clinical outcomes and patient adherence. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, outcomes‐blinded trial designed to compare pharmaceutical care follow‐up with standard care. After standard follow‐up at the cardiology clinic, patients in the intervention group were seen by a clinical pharmacist two to five times as required over seven months. Pharmacists were trained to use motivational interviewing in the consultations and they tailored their support to each patient’s clinical needs and beliefs about medicines. The primary study end‐point was the proportion of patients who reached the treatment goal for low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol by 12 months after discharge. The key secondary outcome was patient adherence to lipid‐lowering therapy at 15 months after discharge, and other secondary outcomes were the effects on patient adherence to other preventive drugs, systolic blood pressure, disease‐specific quality of life, and healthcare use. Results: 316 patients were included. The proportion of patients who reached the target for low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol were 37.0% in the intervention group and 44.2% in the control group (P =.263). More intervention than control patients were adherent to cholesterol‐lowering drugs (88 vs 77%; P =.033) and aspirin (97 vs 91%; P =.036) but not to beta‐blocking agents or renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors. Conclusions: Our intervention had no positive effects on risk factors for CHD, but it increased patient adherence. Further investigation of the intervention process is needed to explore the difference in results between patient adherence and medication effects. Longer follow‐up of healthcare use and mortality will determine if the increased adherence per se eventually will have a meaningful effect on patient health.

AB  - Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) in the United States. Multiple risk factors contribute to DKD development, yet few interventions target more than a single DKD risk factor at a time. This manuscript describes the study protocol, recruitment, and baseline participant characteristics for the Simultaneous Risk Factor Control Using Telehealth to slOw Progression of Diabetic Kidney Disease (STOP‐DKD) study. The STOP‐DKD study is a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifactorial behavioral and medication management intervention to mitigate kidney function decline at 3 years compared to usual care. The intervention consists of up to 36 monthly educational modules delivered via telephone by a study pharmacist, home blood pressure monitoring, and medication management recommendations delivered electronically to primary care physicians. Patients seen at seven primary care clinics in North Carolina, with diabetes and [1] uncontrolled hypertension and [2] evidence of kidney dysfunction (albuminuria or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) were eligible to participate. Study recruitment completed in December 2014. Of the 281 participants randomized, mean age at baseline was 61.9; 52% were male, 56% were Black, and most were high school graduates (89%). Baseline co‐morbidity was high‐ mean blood pressure was 134/76 mmHg, mean body mass index was 35.7 kg/m2, mean eGFR was 80.7 ml/min/1.73 m2, and mean glycated hemoglobin was 8.0%. Experiences of recruiting and implementing a comprehensive DKD program to individuals at high risk seen in the primary care setting are provided. Trial Registration:NCT01829256.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite a variety of efficient and cost‐effective antihypertensive medication, hypertension remains a serious health and economic burden. High consumption of cardiovascular drugs in the Slovak Republic does result neither in better hypertension control nor in significant decrease in cardiovascular mortality. At the same time, Slovakia has alarmingly low patients' adherence to medication intake. Studies have shown the efficiency of short messaging service (SMS) reminders to improve patients' adherence and health outcomes at low costs. Since SMS is popular among Slovaks, this approach may be feasible also in Slovakia. The primary objective is to assess if daily SMS reminders of antihypertensive medication intake provided by pharmacists in addition to the standard pharmaceutical care increase the proportion of adherent older hypertensive ambulatory patients. METHODS: The SPPA trial is a pragmatic randomized parallel group (1:1) trial in 300 older hypertensive patients carried out in community pharmacies in Slovakia. Trial pharmacies will be selected from all main regions of Slovakia. Trial intervention comprises daily personalized SMS reminders of medication intake embedded into usual pharmaceutical practice. The primary outcome is a combined adherence endpoint consisting of subjective self‐reported medication adherence via the eight‐item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS‐8) and objective pill count rate. Secondary outcomes include: change in the MMAS‐8; comparison of adherence rates using pill count; change in systolic blood pressure; and patient satisfaction. Also, direct treatment costs will be evaluated and a cost‐effectiveness analysis will be carried out. DISCUSSION: The SPPA trial engages community pharmacists and mobile health (mHealth) technologies via evidence‐based pharmaceutical care to efficiently and cost‐effectively addresses current main healthcare challenges: high prevalence of hypertension; overconsumption of cardiovascular medicines; low adherence to medication treatment; and resulting uncontrolled blood pressure. The results may identify new possibilities and capacities in healthcare with low additional costs and high value to patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03105687 .

AB  - Background: It is important to understand which components of successful multifaceted interventions are responsible for study outcomes, since some components may be more important contributors to the intervention effect than others. Objective: We conducted a mediation analysis to determine which of seven factors had the greatest effect on change in systolic blood pressure (BP) after 6 months in a trial to improve hypertension control. Design: The study was a preplanned secondary analysis of a cluster‐randomized clinical trial. Eight clinics in an integrated health system were randomized to provide usual care to their patients (n = 222), and eight were randomized to provide a telemonitoring intervention (n = 228). Participants: Four hundred three of 450 trial participants completing the 6‐month follow‐up visit were included. Interventions: Intervention group participants received home BP telemonitors and transmitted measurements to pharmacists, who adjusted medications and provided advice to improve adherence to medications and lifestyle modification via telephone visits. Main measures: Path analytic models estimated indirect effects of the seven potential mediators of intervention effect (defined as the difference between the intervention and usual care groups in change in systolic BP from baseline to 6 months). The potential mediators were change in home BP monitor use, number of BP medication classes, adherence to BP medications, physical activity, salt intake, alcohol use, and weight. Key Results: The difference in change in systolic BP was 11.3 mmHg. The multivariable mediation model explained 47 % (5.3 mmHg) of the intervention effect. Nearly all of this was mediated by two factors: an increase in medication treatment intensity (24 %) and increased home BP monitor use (19 %). The other five factors were not significant mediators, although medication adherence and salt intake improved more in the intervention group than in the usual care group. Conclusions: Most of the explained intervention effect was attributable to the combination of self‐monitoring and medication intensification. High adherence at baseline and the relatively low intensity of resources directed toward lifestyle change may explain why these factors did not contribute to the improvement in BP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most diabetic and hypertensive patients, principally the elderly, do not achieve adequate disease control and consume 5%‐15% of annual health care budgets. Previous studies verified that pharmaceutical care is useful for achieving adequate disease control in diabetes and hypertension. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the economic cost and the incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality‐adjusted life‐year (QALY) of pharmaceutical care in the management of diabetes and hypertension in elderly patients in a primary public health care system in a developing country. METHODS: A 36‐month randomized controlled clinical trial was performed with 200 patients who were divided into a control group (n = 100) and an intervention group (n = 100). The control group received the usual care offered by the Primary Health Care Unit (medical and nurse consultations). The intervention group received the usual care plus a pharmaceutical care intervention. The intervention and control groups were compared with regard to the direct costs of health services (i.e., general practitioner, specialist, nurse, and pharmacist appointments; emergency room visits; and drug therapy costs) and the ICER per QALY. These evaluations used the health system perspective. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found between the intervention and control groups in total direct health care costs ($281.97 +/‐ $49.73 per patient vs. $212.28 +/‐ $43.49 per patient, respectively; P = 0.089); pharmaceutical care added incremental costs of $69.60 (+/‐ $7.90) per patient. The ICER per QALY was $53.50 (95% CI = $51.60‐ $54.00; monetary amounts are given in U.S. dollars). Every clinical parameter evaluated improved for the pharmaceutical care group, whereas these clinical parameters remained unchanged in the usual care group. The difference in differences (DID) tests indicated that for each clinical parameter, the patients in the intervention group improved more from pre to post than the control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: While pharmaceutical care did not significantly increase total direct health care costs, significantly improved health outcomes were seen. The mean ICER per QALY gained suggests a favorable cost‐effectiveness.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the effect of a pharmaceutical care program on the coronary heart disease risk in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients. METHODS: A total of 200 elderly (> 60 years) diabetic and/or hypertensive patients were recruited into a randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial with a 36‐month follow‐up, developed in a public primary health care unit in a municipality in the Brazilian State of Sao Paulo. A range of clinical measurements were evaluated at the baseline and up to 36 months afterwards. The intervention group patients received pharmaceutical care from a clinical pharmacist, whereas the control group patients received their usual care from the medical and nursing staff. The Framingham scoring method was used to estimate changes in the 10‐year coronary heart disease risk scores of all the patients. RESULTS: A total of 194 patients completed the study. Significant reductions (p < 0.05) in the mean values (baseline vs. 36 months) for the systolic blood pressure [156.7 mmHg vs 133.7 mmHg; P < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (106.6 mmHg vs. 91.6 mmHg; P < 0.001),fasting glucose (135.1 mg/dL vs. 107.9 mg/dL; P < 0.001), hemoglobin A1C (7.7% vs. 7.0%; P <0.001), triglycerides (206.0 mg/dL vs. 152.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001), low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)cholesterol (112.4 mg/dL vs. 102.0 mg/dL; P < 0.001), high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (55.5 mg/dL vs. 65.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001), total cholesterol (202.5 mg/dL vs. 185.9 mg/dL; P < 0.001), body mass index (26.2 kg/m2 vs. 26.1 kg/m2; P < 0.001), and abdominal circumference (103.2 cm vs. 102.5 cm; P= 0.001) were observed in the intervention group, whereas no significant changes were verified in the control group. The mean Framingham risk prediction score in the intervention group was 6.8% at baseline and decreased to 4.5%; P < 0.001) after 36 months, but remained unchanged in the control group. CONCLUSION: The pharmaceutical care program resulted in better clinical measurements and reduced the cardiovascular risk scores in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients over a 36‐month period.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Current intervention programme to improve drug adherence are either too complex or expensive for implementation and scale‐up in low‐middle‐income countries. The aim of this study is to assess the process and effects of implementing a low‐cost, targeted and tailored pharmacist intervention among patients with type 2 diabetes who are non‐adherent to antihypertensive drugs in a real‐world primary care Indonesian setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cluster randomised controlled trial with a 3‐month follow‐up will be conducted in 10 community health centres (CHCs) in Indonesia. Type 2 diabetes patients aged 18 years and older who reported non‐adherence to antihypertensive drugs according to the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) are eligible to participate. Patients in CHCs randomised to the intervention group will receive a tailored intervention based on their personal adherence barriers. Interventions may include reminders, habit‐based strategies, family support, counselling to educate and motivate patients, and strategies to address other drug‐related problems. Interventions will be provided at baseline and at a 1‐month follow‐up. Simple question‐based flowcharts and an innovative adherence intervention wheel are provided to support the pharmacy staff. Patients in CHCs randomised to the control group will receive usual care based on the Indonesian guideline. The primary outcome is the between‐group difference in medication adherence change from baseline to 3‐month follow‐up assessed by MARS. Secondary outcomes include changes in patients' blood pressure, their medication beliefs assessed by the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ)‐specific, as well as process characteristics of the intervention programme from a pharmacist and patient perspective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee of Universitas Padjadjaran, Indonesia (No. 859/UN6.KEP/EC/2019) and all patients will provide written informed consent prior to participation. The findings of the study will be disseminated through international conferences, one or more peer‐reviewed journals and reports to key stakeholders. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04023734.

AB  - Objectives: The Hyperlink trial tested a 12‐month intervention of home blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring with pharmacist case management in adults with uncontrolled hypertension. The intervention resulted in improved BP control compared with usual care at both 6 (72% vs. 45%; P < 0.001) and 12 months (71% vs. 53%; P = 0.005). We sought to investigate factors contributing to intervention success. Design: Mixed‐methods analysis of process of care data, patient focus groups, and pharmacist interviews. Participants: Data from 228 intervention patients were examined from the original 450 patients randomly assigned from 16 primary care clinics. Five patient focus groups and 4 pharmacist interviews were conducted to ascertain the patient and pharmacist perspective. Focus group and interview data were coded, and themes relevant to pharmacists were identified. Outcome measures: Home BP readings of less than 135/85 mm Hg and patient focus group and pharmacist interview themes. Results: Mean BP at the intake visit was 148/85 mm Hg. Antihypertensive medications were adjusted in 10% of patients at the initial in‐person visit, 33% at phone visit 1, 36% at phone visit 2, and 19% at phone visit 3. Thereafter, medication changes declined. The mean home BP for patients at the first phone visit was 136/80 mm Hg, 126/74 mm Hg at 3 months, and 123/73 mm Hg at 5 months, with little change thereafter. Key components of success from patient and pharmacist interviews included a strong patient–pharmacist relationship, individualized treatment plans, and frequent phone contact with the pharmacist. Conclusion: Frequent adjustments to the antihypertensive treatment regimen based on home BP telemonitoring resulted in rapid lowering of BP. Our results suggest that an intensive telephone‐based intervention with the key components of medication adjustments, a strong patient and pharmacist relationship, and individualized treatment plans can achieve BP control in only 3 months in many patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Only about half of patients with high blood pressure (BP) in the United States have their BP controlled. Practical, robust, and sustainable models are needed to improve BP control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an intervention combining home BP telemonitoring with pharmacist case management improves BP control compared with usual care and to determine whether BP control is maintained after the intervention is stopped. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A cluster randomized clinical trial of 450 adults with uncontrolled BP recruited from 14,692 patients with electronic medical records across 16 primary care clinics in an integrated health system in Minneapolis‐St Paul, Minnesota, with 12 months of intervention and 6 months of postintervention follow‐up. INTERVENTIONS: Eight clinics were randomized to provide usual care to patients (n = 222) and 8 clinics were randomized to provide a telemonitoring intervention (n = 228). Intervention patients received home BP telemonitors and transmitted BP data to pharmacists who adjusted antihypertensive therapy accordingly. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Control of systolic BP to less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP to less than 90 mm Hg (<130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were change in BP, patient satisfaction, and BP control at 18 months (6 months after intervention stopped). RESULTS: At baseline, enrollees were 45% women, 82% white, mean (SD) age was 61.1 (12.0) years, and mean systolic BP was 148 mm Hg and diastolic BP was 85 mm Hg. Blood pressure was controlled at both 6 and 12 months in 57.2% (95% CI, 44.8% to 68.7%) of patients in the telemonitoring intervention group vs 30.0% (95% CI, 23.2% to 37.8%) of patients in the usual care group (P = .001). At 18 months (6 months of postintervention follow‐up), BP was controlled in 71.8% (95% CI, 65.0% to 77.8%) of patients in the telemonitoring intervention group vs 57.1% (95% CI, 51.5% to 62.6%) of patients in the usual care group (P = .003). Compared with the usual care group, systolic BP decreased more from baseline among patients in the telemonitoring intervention group at 6 months (‐10.7 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐14.3 to ‐7.3 mm Hg]; P<.001), at 12 months (‐9.7 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐13.4 to ‐6.0 mm Hg]; P<.001), and at 18 months (‐6.6 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐10.7 to ‐2.5 mm Hg]; P = .004). Compared with the usual care group, diastolic BP decreased more from baseline among patients in the telemonitoring intervention group at 6 months (‐6.0 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐8.6 to ‐3.4 mm Hg]; P<.001), at 12 months (‐5.1 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐7.4 to ‐2.8 mm Hg]; P<.001), and at 18 months (‐3.0 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐6.3 to 0.3 mm Hg]; P = .07). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Home BP telemonitoring and pharmacist case management achieved better BP control compared with usual care during 12 months of intervention that persisted during 6 months of postintervention follow‐up.

AB  - This study examined achievement of blood pressure (BP) goals, changes in antihypertensive therapy and reasons for these changes among adults with  hypertension initiating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs),  angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Claims  data were examined for changes to medication regimens. Patient charts for 501  patients provided BP levels and reasons for changing medications. BP goal  achievement was highest for initiators of ARBs (81.4%), compared with ACEIs  (75.5%; P=NS) and CCBs (68.9%; P<0.01). Changes in antihypertensive therapy were  least likely among ARB recipients (59.9%) compared with ACEIs (71.86%; P=0.02)  and CCBs (74.85%; P<0.01). Failure to achieve BP goals was the most common reason  for change in therapy (ARB, 32.9%; ACEI, 42.5%, P=NS; CCB, 47.9%, P<0.01).  Although most patients achieved target BP goals, many required changes in  treatment regimens. Initial choice of antihypertensive therapy may mitigate  changes in therapies and better achieve BP goals.

T2  - Journal of managed care pharmacy : JMCP
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication therapy management (MTM) was officially recognized by the federal government in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and  Modernization Act of 2003, which requires Medicare Part D plans that offer  prescription drug coverage to establish MTM programs (MTMPs) for eligible  beneficiaries. Even though the term "MTM" was first used in 2003, pharmacists  have provided similar services since the term "pharmaceutical care" was  introduced in 1990. Fairview Health Services, a large integrated health care  system, implemented a standardized pharmaceutical care service system in 1998,  naming it a pharmaceutical care-based MTM practice in 2006. OBJECTIVE: To present  the clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes of 10 years of delivering MTM  services to patients in a health care delivery system. METHODS: Data from MTM  services provided to 9,068 patients and documented in electronic therapeutic  records were retrospectively analyzed over the 10-year period from September 1998  to September 2008 in 1 health system with 48 primary care clinics. Patients  eligible for MTM services were aged 21 years or older and either paid for MTM out  of pocket or met their health care payer's criteria for MTM reimbursement; the  criteria varied for Medicaid, Medicare, and commercially insured enrollees. All  MTM was delivered face to face. Health data extracted from the electronic  therapeutic record by the present study's investigators included patient  demographics, medication list, medical conditions, drug therapy problems  identified and addressed, change in clinical status, and pharmacist-estimated  cost savings. The clinical status assessment was a comparison of the first and  most recent MTM visit to measure whether the patient achieved the goals of  therapy for each medical condition (e.g., the blood pressure of a patient with  diabetes and hypertension will be less than 130/80 millimeters mercury [mmHg] in  1 month; the patient with allergic rhinitis will be relieved of his complaints of  nasal congestion, runny nose, and eye itching within 5 days). Goals were set  according to evidence-based literature and patient-specific targets determined  cooperatively by pharmacists, patients, and physicians. Cost-savings calculations  represented MTM pharmacists' estimates of medical services (e.g., office visits,  laboratory services, urgent care visits, emergency room visits) and lost work  time avoided by the intervention. All short-term (3-month) estimated health care  savings that resulted from addressing drug therapy problems were analyzed. The  expenses of these avoided services were calculated using the health system's  contracted rates for services provided in the last quarter of 2008. The return on  investment (ROI) was calculated by dividing the pharmacist-estimated savings by  the cost of MTM services in 2008 (number of MTM encounters times the average cost  of an MTM visit). The humanistic impact of MTM services was assessed using the  results from the second patient satisfaction survey administered in 2008 (new  patients seen from January through December 2008) for the health system's MTM  program. RESULTS: A total of 9,068 patient records were in the documentation  system as of September 30, 2008. During the 10-year period, there were 33,706  documented encounters (mean 3.7 encounters per patient). Of 38,631 drug therapy  problems identified and addressed by MTM pharmacists, the most frequent were a  need for additional drug therapy (n = 10,870, 28.1%) and subtherapeutic dosage (n  = 10,100, 26.1%). In the clinical status assessment of the 12,851 medical  conditions in 4,849 patients who were not at goal when they enrolled in the  program, 7,068 conditions (55.0%) improved, 2,956 (23.0%) were unchanged, and  2,827 (22.0%) worsened during the course of MTM services. Pharmacist-estimated  cost savings to the health system over the 10-year period were $2,913,850 ($86  per encounter) and the total cost of MTM was $2,258,302 ($67 per encounter), for  an estimated ROI of $1.29 per $1 in MTM administrative costs. In the patient  satisfaction survey, 95.3% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that their  overall health and wellbeing had improved because of MTM. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist  estimates of the impact of an MTM program in a large integrated health care  system suggest that the program was associated with improved clinical outcomes  and cost savings. Patient satisfaction with the program was high.

T2  - Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)
AB  - Treatment of hypertension among hospitalized patients represents an opportunity to improve blood pressure recognition and treatment. To address this issue, the  authors examined patterns of antihypertensive medication prescribing among 5668  hypertensive inpatients. Outcomes were treatment with any antihypertensive  medication and treatment with first-line therapy, defined as  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, or  calcium channel blockers. Logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex,  race, length of stay, service line, and comorbidity were used for all  comparisons. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for treatment were higher for  men (1.4, P<.001), older patients (2.5 for age older than 80 vs 1.0 for age  younger than 40; P<.001), non-white race (1.2 vs 1.0 for white race; P<.004), and  generalist service line (1.4 vs 1.0 for all other services; P<.001).  Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for receiving first-line agents were higher for  older patients and generalist service line. Among surgical patients, receipt of  medical consultation was only marginally associated with higher odds of  antihypertensive or first-line treatment after adjustment for relevant clinical  variables. Demographic factors and service line appear to play a major role in  determining the likelihood of inpatient hypertension treatment. Understanding and  addressing these disparities has the potential to incrementally improve  hypertension control rates in the population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One approach postulated to improve the provision of health care is effective utilization of team-based care including pharmacists. OBJECTIVE: The  objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive systematic review with  focused meta-analyses to examine the effects of pharmacist-provided direct  patient care on therapeutic, safety, and humanistic outcomes. METHODS: The  following databases were searched from inception to January 2009: NLM PubMed;  Ovid/MEDLINE; ABI/INFORM; Health Business Fulltext Elite; Academic Search  Complete; International Pharmaceutical Abstracts; PsycINFO; Cochrane Database of  Systematic Reviews; National Guideline Clearinghouse; Database of Abstracts of  Reviews of Effects; ClinicalTrials.gov; LexisNexis Academic Universe; and Google  Scholar. Studies selected included those reporting pharmacist-provided care,  comparison groups, and patient-related outcomes. Of these, 56,573 citations were  considered. Data were extracted by multidisciplinary study review teams.  Variables examined included study characteristics, pharmacists'  interventions/services, patient characteristics, and study outcomes. Data for  meta-analyses were extracted from randomized controlled trials meeting  meta-analysis criteria. RESULTS: A total of 298 studies were included. Favorable  results were found in therapeutic and safety outcomes, and meta-analyses  conducted for hemoglobin A1c, LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and adverse drug  events were significant (P < 0.05), favoring pharmacists' direct patient care  over comparative services. Results for humanistic outcomes were favorable with  variability. Medication adherence, patient knowledge, and quality of life-general  health meta-analyses were significant (P < 0.05), favoring pharmacists' direct  patient care. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist-provided direct patient care has favorable  effects across various patient outcomes, health care settings, and disease  states. Incorporating pharmacists as health care team members in direct patient  care is a viable solution to help improve US health care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Contemporary trends in the management and outcomes of chronic kidney disease patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction have not been  adequately described, particularly from the more generalizable perspective of a  population-based investigation. METHODS: The study population consisted of 6219  residents of the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan area who were  hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction in 6 annual periods between 1995  and 2005. Patients were categorized as having preserved kidney function (n=3154),  mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (n=2313), or severe chronic kidney  disease (n=752) at the time of hospital admission. RESULTS: Patients with chronic  kidney disease were more likely to be older, to have a greater prevalence of  comorbidities, and to experience significant in-hospital complications or die  during hospitalization in comparison with patients with preserved kidney  function. Although patients with chronic kidney disease were less likely to  receive effective cardiac medications or undergo coronary interventional  procedures than patients without kidney disease, we observed a marked increase in  the use of effective cardiac medications and coronary interventional procedures  in patients with chronic kidney disease during the period under study.  In-hospital death rates declined over time among patients with chronic kidney  disease, whereas these death rates remained unchanged among persons with normal  kidney function. CONCLUSION: The results of this study in residents of a large  New England metropolitan area provide insights into changing trends in the  treatment and impact of chronic kidney disease in patients hospitalized with  acute myocardial infarction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with diabetes have poor blood pressure (BP) control. Pharmacological therapy is the cornerstone of effective BP treatment, yet there  are high rates both of poor medication adherence and failure to intensify  medications. Successful medication management requires an effective partnership  between providers who initiate and increase doses of effective medications and  patients who adhere to the regimen. METHODS: In this cluster-randomized  controlled effectiveness study, primary care teams within sites were randomized  to a program led by a clinical pharmacist trained in motivational  interviewing-based behavioral counseling approaches and authorized to make BP  medication changes or to usual care. This study involved the collection of data  during a 14-month intervention period in three Department of Veterans Affairs  facilities and two Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities. The clinical  pharmacist was supported by clinical information systems that enabled proactive  identification of, and outreach to, eligible patients identified on the basis of  poor BP control and either medication refill gaps or lack of recent medication  intensification. The primary outcome is the relative change in systolic blood  pressure (SBP) measurements over time. Secondary outcomes are changes in  Hemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), medication adherence  determined from pharmacy refill data, and medication intensification rates.  DISCUSSION: Integration of the three intervention elements--proactive  identification, adherence counseling and medication intensification--is essential  to achieve optimal levels of control for high-risk patients. Testing the  effectiveness of this intervention at the team level allows us to study the  program as it would typically be implemented within a clinic setting, including  how it integrates with other elements of care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The  ClinicalTrials.gov registration number is NCT00495794.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study compared the clinical characteristics, use of guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy, and outcomes of patients diagnosed as  having bipolar disorder who were exclusively seen in Department of Veteran  Affairs (VA) primary care settings with those of patients with bipolar disorder  who received any VA mental health services. METHODS: Data from the 1999 Large  Health Survey of Veterans were linked to VA data from the National Psychosis  Registry to identify patients diagnosed as having bipolar disorder (N=14,643).  Multivariable analyses adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and  clinical and severity factors determined whether exclusive primary care use  versus any mental health care use was associated with poor clinical and services  outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 7.6% used primary care services exclusively. Compared  with persons who used specialty care services, those who used primary care  exclusively were more likely to be diagnosed as having cardiovascular disease  (odds ratio [OR]=1.26, p<.05) or hypertension (OR=1.31, p<.01), less likely to  receive guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy (OR=.18, p<.001), more likely to  have an inpatient medical visit (OR=1.36, p<.01), and less likely to have an  inpatient psychiatric visit (OR=.36, p<.001). Persons who received only primary  care were more likely to have worse physical health and better mental health, as  measured by the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with  bipolar disorder treated in primary care settings were more likely than those who  received some care in a mental health specialty setting to have comorbid general  medical disorders. Optimal care settings for patients with bipolar disorder may  require strategies that address gaps in general medical as well as psychiatric  care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore treatment patterns and resource utilization and cost for subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). RESEARCH DESIGN:  Retrospective claims database analysis of 706 patients with PAH enrolled in a  large, geographically diverse US managed-care organization. RESULTS: In the final  sample of PAH patients treated with bosentan (n=251) or sildenafil (n=455),  average age was 57 years, 86% of patients were commercially insured, and 52% of  patients were male. Gender distribution varied significantly across subgroups,  with a lower proportion of males in the bosentan (30%) subgroup compared with the  sildenafil group (64%) (p<0.001). Average baseline Charlson comorbidity score was  2.4. Average numbers of fills per month were 0.8 and 0.4 for bosentan and  sildenafil patients, respectively (p<0.001). Over 80% of patients received only  one PAH treatment in the first 90 days following the index date, with 28% of  bosentan and 13% of sildenafil patients receiving combination therapy (p<0.001).  Over one-third of bosentan patients and one-quarter of sildenafil patients  experienced a dose increase in the follow-up period (p=0.009). Sixteen percent of  sildenafil patients experienced a dose decrease in the follow-up period, while a  smaller proportion of patients receiving bosentan (4%) experienced a dose  decrease (p<0.001). On average, number of PAH-related per subject per month  (PSPM) inpatient stays and emergency department visits and PSPM length of  inpatient stays were statistically similar between the subgroups. PAH-related  PSPM healthcare costs were high for both subgroups, with average monthly costs of  $5,332 and $3,632 among bosentan and sildenafil patients, respectively (p=0.003).  Differences in total costs were driven mainly by differences in pharmacy  expenditures. CONCLUSIONS: Of the oral agents approved for treating PAH at the  time of this study, sildenafil was most commonly prescribed as index therapy and  was also associated with the lowest costs, largely due to significantly lower  pharmacy costs. This study is characterized by limitations inherent to claims  database analyses, such as the potential for coding errors and lack of  information on whether a drug was taken as prescribed. Furthermore, PAH severity  (WHO functional class) was not assessed.

T2  - Journal of the American Medical Directors Association
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe antihypertensive medication use, determine what effects comorbid illness has on prescribing of  commonly used antihypertensive medications, and explore how treatment affected  selected clinical and functional outcomes in US nursing home residents. DESIGN:  Cross-sectional observational study using data from the 2004 National Nursing  Home Survey, a nationally representative sample of US nursing home residents.  RESULTS: More than one half, 53.8%, of all residents had hypertension as a  primary admission or current diagnosis. A large majority (84%) of residents with  the diagnosis of hypertension were receiving at least one legend medication  indicated for hypertension. The most common selection of pharmacologic agent was  monotherapy with diuretics in 11% of all residents receiving antihypertensive  medications. Hypertensive residents with a diagnosis of arrhythmia (odds ratio  [OR] = 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-1.38), stroke (OR = 1.18, 95% CI  = 1.05-1.34), or heart failure (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.04-1.32) were more likely  to be receiving a beta blocker. Those with diabetes (OR = 0.86, 95% CI =  0.77-0.96), depression (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.70-0.87), constipation (OR = 0.72,  95% CI = 0.61-0.84), or asthma (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.34-0.74) were less likely  to be receiving a beta blocker. Hospital admission was less likely (OR = 0.50,  95% CI = 0.36-0.69) when residents were taking any commonly used antihypertensive  medication (diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme/angiotensin  receptor blockers [ACE/ARBs], calcium channel blockers, or alpha-blockers) but  significantly more likely when therapy included a beta blocker (OR = 1.45, 95% CI  = 1.18 - 1.78). Beta blockers were associated with an increased likelihood of  falls (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.04-1.27) and a decreased likelihood of constipation  (OR 0.72, 95% CI = 0.61-0.84). Beta blockers were associated with a decreased  likelihood of depression (OR 0.83, 95% CI = 0.74-0.92) as was the use of any  commonly used antihypertensive (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.63-0.90). CONCLUSION:  Hypertension is prevalent in US nursing home residents and most residents with  that diagnosis (84%) are being treated with antihypertensive medication. Through  examination of the National Nursing Home Survey database, associations between  the use of selected antihypertensive medication, comorbid illness, and specified  outcomes were observed.

TI  - Costs of chronic disease management for newly insured adults.
AU  - Gilmer, Todd
T2  - Medical care
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Healthcare reform will result in substantial numbers of newly insured, low-income adults with chronic conditions. This paper examines the costs of a  chronic disease management program among newly insured adults with diabetes  and/or hypertension. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Low-income adults with diabetes  and/or hypertension were provided County-sponsored health insurance coverage and  access to disease management. Health econometric methods were used to compare  costs among participants in disease management to nonparticipants, both overall  and in comparison between those who were newly insured versus previously insured  under an alternative County-sponsored insurance product. Costs were also compared  between those who qualified for County-sponsored coverage due to diabetes versus  hypertension. RESULTS: Annual inpatient costs were $1260 lower, and outpatient  costs were $723 greater, among participants in disease management (P<0.001 each).  Participants in disease management without previous County-sponsored coverage had  higher pharmacy costs ($154, P=0.002) than nonparticipants; whereas participants  with diabetes had marginally significant lower overall costs compared with  nonparticipants ($-685, P=0.070). CONCLUSIONS: Disease management was successful  in increasing the use of outpatient services among participants. The offsetting  costs of the program suggest that disease management should be considered for  some newly insured populations, especially for adults with diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine which of 3 interventions was most effective in improving blood pressure (BP) control, we performed a 4-arm randomized trial with 18-month  follow-up at the primary care clinics at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center.  METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized to either usual care or 1 of 3  telephone-based intervention groups: (1) nurse-administered behavioral  management, (2) nurse- and physician-administered medication management, or (3) a  combination of both. Of the 1551 eligible patients, 593 individuals were  randomized; 48% were African American. The intervention telephone calls were  triggered based on home BP values transmitted via telemonitoring devices.  Behavioral management involved promotion of health behaviors. Medication  management involved adjustment of medications by a study physician and nurse  based on hypertension treatment guidelines. RESULTS: The primary outcome was  change in BP control measured at 6-month intervals over 18 months. Both the  behavioral management and medication management alone showed significant  improvements at 12 months-12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6%-24.1%) and  12.5% (95% CI, 1.3%-23.6%), respectively-but not at 18 months. In subgroup  analyses, among those with poor baseline BP control, systolic BP decreased in the  combined intervention group by 14.8 mm Hg (95% CI, -21.8 to -7.8 mm Hg) at 12  months and 8.0 mm Hg (95% CI, -15.5 to -0.5 mm Hg) at 18 months, relative to  usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Overall intervention effects were moderate, but among  individuals with poor BP control at baseline, the effects were larger. This study  indicates the importance of identifying individuals most likely to benefit from  potentially resource intensive programs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov  Identifier: NCT00237692.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of community pharmacists on clinical outcomes in Hispanic patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: 126 patients were enrolled in  this longitudinal pre/post cohort study that took place in nine community and  four workplace pharmacies in San Antonio, TX. Pharmacists provided education,  point-of-care testing for glycemic and metabolic parameters, clinical assessment,  goal setting, and drug therapy management with physicians. Study outcomes were  changes in glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and accompanying metabolic parameters  (blood pressure, lipid parameters, and body mass index) during a 1-year time  frame. RESULTS: In the overall cohort, A1C was not reduced significantly from  baseline to 12 months (7.8% vs. 7.6%, P = 0.516). However, statistically  significant reductions occurred for fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, and  diastolic blood pressure. None of the other parameters was affected  significantly. In the subgroup of patients not at target values at baseline,  significant reductions occurred for A1C (9.2% vs. 8.6%, P = 0.001), systolic  blood pressure (147 vs. 143 mm Hg, P = 0.031), diastolic blood pressure (91 vs.  87 mm Hg, P < 0.001), triglycerides (259 vs. 219 mg/dL, P < 0.001), LDL  cholesterol (139 vs. 123 mg/dL, P < 0.001), and total cholesterol (237 vs. 222  mg/dL, P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Interventions performed by community pharmacists  are effective in improving clinical outcomes in a Hispanic cohort with diabetes.  Pharmacists' efforts were most successful in patients not at target glycemic and  metabolic levels.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of integrated care for chronic physical diseases and depression in reducing disability and improving quality of life.  DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial of multi-condition collaborative care for  depression and poorly controlled diabetes and/or risk factors for coronary heart  disease compared with usual care among middle aged and elderly people SETTING:  Fourteen primary care clinics in Seattle, Washington. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with  diabetes or coronary heart disease, or both, and blood pressure above 140/90 mm  Hg, low density lipoprotein concentration >3.37 mmol/L, or glycated haemoglobin  8.5% or higher, and PHQ-9 depression scores of ≥ 10. INTERVENTION: A 12 month  intervention to improve depression, glycaemic control, blood pressure, and lipid  control by integrating a "treat to target" programme for diabetes and risk  factors for coronary heart disease with collaborative care for depression. The  intervention combined self management support, monitoring of disease control, and  pharmacotherapy to control depression, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and  hyperlipidaemia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Social role disability (Sheehan  disability scale), global quality of life rating, and World Health Organization  disability assessment schedule (WHODAS-2) scales to measure disabilities in  activities of daily living (mobility, self care, household maintenance). RESULTS:  Of 214 patients enrolled (106 intervention and 108 usual care), disability and  quality of life measures were obtained for 97 intervention patients at six months  (92%) and 92 at 12 months (87%), and for 96 usual care patients at six months  (89%) and 92 at 12 months (85%). Improvements from baseline on the Sheehan  disability scale (-0.9, 95% confidence interval -1.5 to -0.2; P = 0.006) and  global quality of life rating (0.7, 0.2 to 1.2; P = 0.005) were significantly  greater at six and 12 months in patients in the intervention group. There was a  trend toward greater improvement in disabilities in activities of daily living  (-1.5, -3.3 to 0.4; P = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Integrated care that covers chronic  physical disease and comorbid depression can reduce social role disability and  enhance global quality of life.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess antihypertensive treatment practices and outcomes for patients with acute severe hypertension requiring hospitalization. DESIGN:  Subanalysis of a multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study. DATA SOURCE:  The STAT registry (data from 25 hospitals). PATIENTS: A total of 1184 consecutive  adults with acute severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 180 mm Hg,  diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg), without a neurologic reason for admission,  receiving two or more intermittent intravenous antihypertensive doses or a  continuous intravenous infusion within 24 hours of hospitalization. MEASUREMENTS  AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients started intravenous antihypertensive therapy 1.3  (median [interquartile range (IQR) 0.5-3.2]) hours after the qualifying SBP  (median 204 [IQR 190-221] mm Hg). Labetalol (27%), metoprolol (21%), and  nitroglycerin (20%) were the most frequent initial intravenous choices. For the  43% of patients administered two or more intravenous agents sequentially, the 24%  receiving three or more, and the 8% receiving four or more, median SBPs at the  time of the second, third, and fourth additions were 186 (IQR 168-211), 176 (IQR  152-196), and 164 (IQR 143-193) mm Hg, respectively. Most common continuous  intravenous infusions were nitroglycerin (30%), nicardipine (13%), and labetalol  (7%). After the first intravenous agent, an SBP decrease of 10-25% was achieved  at 1 and 6 hours in 48% and 72%, respectively. Of the 6% without at least a 10%  decrease in SBP during the entire hospitalization, labetalol (28%), hydralazine  (21%), and metoprolol (17%) were the most frequent initial intravenous choices.  Hypotension (SBP ≤ 90 mm Hg) occurred in 5% and was most common with intravenous  nitroglycerin (39%). Oral antihypertensives were started within 1 and 6 hours  after the first intravenous therapy in 13% and 34% of patients, respectively,  with many patients (61%) receiving three or more oral agents during  hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Pharmacologic treatment of acute severe hypertension  in patients with nonneurologic causes is heterogeneous and often not consistent  with Joint National Committee recommendations. Patients received numerous  intravenous agents, experienced variable decreases in SBP, often failed to  receive timely oral therapy, and a clinically relevant proportion developed  hypotension.

T2  - The Journal of family practice
AB  - PURPOSE: Despite numerous studies on adherence, there is little research on the first-fill rate of antihypertensive prescriptions. Our study took advantage of  the recent increase in electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) and used data from  e-prescribing physicians to determine the first-fill failure rate of  antihypertensive prescriptions and to assess which factors predict first-fill  failure. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed claims from a Mid-Atlantic  managed care organization (MCO). We included adult members with continuous  medical and pharmacy coverage who were prescribed an antihypertensive in 2008 by  an e-prescribing physician. First-fill failure occurred when the patient did not  obtain the antihypertensive medication due to either a denial by the MCO or  reversal by the dispensing pharmacist. (Pharmacists reverse claims when a patient  fails to pick up a medication.) Multivariate regression analysis determined the  clinical and demographic factors associated with failure to fill. RESULTS: The  cohort consisted of 14,693 antihypertensive prescriptions, prescribed by 164  e-prescribing physicians for 7061 unique members. There were 2289 out of 14,693  prescriptions (15.6%) that went unfilled, affecting 24.3% of patients. Of the  prescriptions not obtained, 1466 (64%) were denied by the MCO and 823 (36%) were  reversed. Significant factors associated with first-fill failure were new  diagnosis of hypertension, new antihypertensive agent, higher co-payment, and  enrollment in a health maintenance organization or preferred provider  organization. CONCLUSIONS: Patients newly diagnosed with hypertension and those  prescribed a new antihypertensive were at particularly high risk for not  obtaining their medication. Because nearly a quarter of patients did not obtain  their initial fill of an antihypertensive prescription, future research should  determine efficient and cost-effective systems to address first-fill failure in  primary care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if a multimodal intervention composed of patient education, home blood pressure (BP) monitoring, BP measurement reporting to an  interactive voice response (IVR) phone system, and clinical pharmacist follow-up  improves BP control compared with usual care. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study  with patient enrollment, medication consultation and adjustment, remote BP  monitoring, and follow-up at 6 months. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial  was conducted at 3 healthcare systems in Denver, Colorado, including a large  health maintenance organization, a Veterans Affairs medical center, and a county  hospital. At each site, patients with uncontrolled BP were randomized to the  multimodal intervention vs usual care for 6 months, with the primary end point of  BP reduction. RESULTS: Of 338 patients randomized, 283 (84%) completed the study,  including 138 intervention patients and 145 usual care patients. Baseline BP was  higher in the intervention group vs the usual care group (150.5/89.4 vs  143.8/85.3 mm Hg). At 6 months, BPs were similar in the intervention group vs the  usual care group (137.4 vs 136.7 mm Hg, P = .85 for systolic; 82.9 vs 81.1 mm Hg,  P = .14 for diastolic). However, BP reductions were greater in the intervention  group vs the usual care group (−13.1 vs −7.1 mm Hg, P = .006 for systolic; −6.5  vs −4.2 mm Hg, P = .07 for diastolic). Adherence to medications was similar  between the 2 groups, but intervention patients had a greater increase in  medication regimen intensity. CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal intervention of patient  education, home BP monitoring, BP measurement reporting to an IVR system, and  clinical pharmacist follow-up achieved greater reductions in BP compared with  usual care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of medication therapy management on chronic disease management and generic drug prescribing in the clinic setting. METHODS:  Private insurer initiates Pay-for-Performance (PFP) project for clinic-based  pharmacists in Iowa and South Dakota (n = 9 clinics) in 2009. Each pharmacist was  assigned ∽300 patients with at least 1 of 4 disease states (diabetes mellitus,  hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and asthma). Pharmacists were expected to complete  2 medication reviews for each patient. The primary outcome was frequency of  patients achieving goal levels: diabetes: hemoglobin A1c (A1c) <8%, low-density  lipoprotein (LDL) <130 mg/dL, and blood pressure (BP) <140/80 mm Hg;  hypertension: BP <140/90 mm Hg; hyperlipidemia: LDL <130 mg/dL; and asthma:  percentage of persistent asthmatics on controller medication. Generic prescribing  rates were evaluated for antihypertensives, cholesterol-lowering agents, proton  pump inhibitors, and antidepressants. RESULTS: A total of 827 patients at 3  clinics were included in the analysis. For diabetes, 77.1% had A1c <8%, 83.2% had  LDL <130 mg/dL, and 76.3% had BP <140/80 mm Hg. For hypertension, 86.2% had BP  <140/90 mm Hg. For hyperlipidemia, 80.6% had LDL <130 mg/dL. For asthma, 100%  were on controller medication. One medication review was completed on 88.8% of  patients. Generic prescribing rates ranged from 65.8% to 79.4%.  IMPLICATIONS/ADAPTABILITY: A high percentage of patients achieved goal levels at  clinics with clinical pharmacist services. A multidisciplinary approach to  patient care may improve disease state management and medication cost savings.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess whether VA MEDIC-E (Veterans Affairs Multi-disciplinary Education and Diabetes Intervention for Cardiac risk reduction[EM DASH] Extended  for 6 months), a pharmacist-led shared medical appointments program, could  improve attainment of target goals for hypertension, hyperglycemia,  hyperlipidemia, and tobacco use in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to  standard primary care after 6 months of intervention. METHODS: A randomized,  controlled trial of VA MEDIC-E (n = 50) versus standard primary care (n = 49) in  veterans with type 2 diabetes, hemoglobin A1c (A1C) > 7%, blood pressure (BP) >  130/80 mmHg, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > 100mg/dl (2.59  mmol/l) in the previous 6 months was conducted. The VA MEDIC-E intervention  consisted of 4 weekly group sessions followed by 5 monthly booster group  sessions. Each 2-hour session included 1 hour of multidisciplinary diabetes  specific healthy lifestyle education and 1 hour of pharmacotherapeutic  interventions performed by a clinical pharmacist. Evaluation measures included  lab values of A1C, LDL cholesterol, BP, and goal attainment of these values, and  diabetes self-care behavior questionnaires at 6 months. RESULTS: The  randomization groups were similar at baseline in all cardiovascular risk factors  except for LDL, which was significantly lower in the MEDIC-E arm. At 6 months,  significant improvements from baseline were found in the intervention arm for  exercise, foot care, and goal attainment of A1C, LDL-C, and BP but not in the  control arm. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the  pharmacist-led group intervention program for 6 months was an efficacious and  sustainable collaborative care approach to managing diabetes and reducing  associated cardiovascular risk.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a diabetes education program that includes a pharmacist as a member of the diabetes management team by  assessing the change in hemoglobin A1c (A1C), cholesterol, and blood pressure for  patients with type 2 diabetes in outpatient clinics. METHODS: This was a  retrospective study in outpatient clinics at Shands Jacksonville Medical Center.  The patients were assigned into either the pharmacist group or the nonpharmacist  group, according to the presence or the absence of a pharmacist in the clinic.  The primary end point was the absolute change in A1C versus baseline. Secondary  end points included change in cholesterol and blood pressure and the number of  patients to attain American Diabetes Association goals. End points were recorded  to correlate within 3 months of the initial visit and final visit with a  provider. RESULTS: Compared to the nonpharmacist group, patients in the  pharmacist group had more advanced and uncontrolled diabetes at baseline. The  pharmacist group showed a greater percent change in A1C and improvement between  the initial and final clinic visits, after adjusting for baseline confounders.  Despite the statistically significant improvement in A1C in the pharmacist group,  there was no difference found between the 2 groups for the end points of  cholesterol and blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Including a pharmacist as a part of  the diabetes management team may result in lower A1C in patients with more  advanced and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus versus a health care team  without a pharmacist.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To further develop and evaluate a diabetes disease state management (DSM) program that provided direct patient care responsibilities to advanced  pharmacy practice experience (APPE) students as members of healthcare teams.  DESIGN: Nine new clinics and 3 established sites that provide self-care  management education to patients with diabetes were established and maintained in  rural Colorado pharmacies and supported by students in APPE training for 48 weeks  per year. EVALUATION: The 12 clinics provided 120 APPE student placements in  2010-2011. Students' perceptions of their experiences were positive. Patients who  completed the student-supported diabetes self-management education program had  improvements in blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid values. CONCLUSIONS:  Twelve diabetes DSM clinics provided direct patient care opportunities to APPE  students working as part of healthcare teams while expanding healthcare resources  in underserved communities in Colorado.

AB  - BACKGROUND: African Americans are significantly more likely than whites to have uncontrolled hypertension, contributing to significant disparities in  cardiovascular disease and events. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to  examine whether there were differences in change in blood pressure (BP) for  African American and non-Hispanic white patients in response to a medication  management and tailored nurse-delivered telephone behavioral program.  PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred and seventy-three patients (284 African American and  289 non-Hispanic white) primary care patients who participated in the  Hypertension Intervention Nurse Telemedicine Study (HINTS) clinical trial.  INTERVENTIONS: Study arms included: 1) nurse-administered, physician-directed  medication management intervention, utilizing a validated clinical decision  support system; 2) nurse-administered, behavioral management intervention; 3)  combined behavioral management and medication management intervention; and 4)  usual care. All interventions were activated based on poorly controlled home BP  values. MAIN MEASURES: Post-hoc analysis of change in systolic and diastolic  blood pressure. General linear models (PROC MIXED in SAS, version 9.2) were used  to estimate predicted means at 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month time points, by  intervention arm and race subgroups (separate models for systolic and diastolic  blood pressure). KEY RESULTS: Improvement in mean systolic blood pressure  post-baseline was greater for African American patients in the combined  intervention, compared to African American patients in usual care, at 12 months  (6.6 mmHg; 95 % CI: -12.5, -0.7; p=0.03) and at 18 months (9.7 mmHg; -16.0, -3.4;  p=0.003). At 18 months, mean diastolic BP was 4.8 mmHg lower (95 % CI: -8.5,  -1.0; p=0.01) among African American patients in the combined intervention arm,  compared to African American patients in usual care. There were no analogous  differences for non-Hispanic white patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of home  BP monitoring, remote medication management, and telephone tailored behavioral  self-management appears to be particularly effective for improving BP among  African Americans. The effect was not seen among non-Hispanic white patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: The impact of pharmacist management of patients with diabetes mellitus enrolled in a rural free clinic was evaluated. METHODS: Data from 95 patients  continuously enrolled in a new pharmacist service were analyzed over 24 months.  Patients were at least 18 years old, qualified for free care on the basis of  income or insurance status, and had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus upon  clinic entry. Under a collaborative agreement, pharmacists educated patients on  diabetes, counseled patients on lifestyle modifications, assessed appropriateness  of drug therapy, and managed drug therapy for diabetes and associated comorbid  conditions. Clinical impact was measured by changes from baseline glycosylated  hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels, blood pressure, and lipid levels over a 24-month  period. Using published cost estimates, the economic impact of the clinic was  calculated based on expected savings for each patient who had a decrease of ≥1%  in HbA(1c) value. RESULTS: Significant reductions from baseline in HbA1c values  (p < 0.0001), systolic blood pressure (p = 0.0011), diastolic blood pressure (p =  0.0015), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.0001), and triglyceride  levels (p = 0.0001) were achieved in clinic patients. Based on an expected  savings of $1,118 per patient who had a decrease of >1% in HbA(1c) value (n =  67), the pharmacist service was estimated to provide a savings of $74,906 per  year. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist management of patients with type 2 diabetes  significantly influenced clinical and economic outcomes in an uninsured  population living in a rural area with few health care resources.

AB  - PURPOSE: Value-based insurance designs (VBID) have been developed by health insurance companies and used by employers to allocate health care resources  appropriately and to lower patients' out-of-pocket costs for services related to  chronic conditions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the  Cincinnati Pharmacy Coaching Program (CPCP) on clinical and economic outcomes.  The CPCP is a VBID implemented by Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield in Ohio. It  provided tailored pharmacist-based educational services and financial incentives  to participants. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental pre/post longitudinal  study in which patients were identified as they enrolled in the CPCP between Jan.  1, 2008, and Dec. 31, 2009. Patients could participate in a Diabetes Coaching  Program (DCP) or a Heart Healthy Coaching Program (HHCP). Control subjects were  selected from patients who were invited but did not choose to participate.  Control subjects were matched to intervention cohorts using propensity score  matching. Clinical (blood pressure, lipid levels, and hemoglobin A1c) and  economic (all-cause and disease-attributable) outcomes were evaluated using  within-subject (pre-post) and between-subject comparison (intervention-control)  design. RESULTS: A total of 607 patients were enrolled in intervention groups,  and 557 control subjects were selected after matching. Significant reductions  were found in blood pressure, lipid levels, and hemoglobin A1c after enrollment,  and a significantly greater proportion of patients, compared with controls,  achieved their clinical goals according to national guidelines in both programs.  Hypertension-related cost trends were favorable for HHCP relative to the control  cohort. Diabetes-related costs increased for all groups from pre- to post-index,  largely driven by office visits and medication costs in the DCP and inpatient/ER  visits in the control cohort. CONCLUSION: Results showed significant improvements  in all diabetes- and hypertension-related clinical measures. This study shows the  effect of a comprehensive VBID on the health of patients with chronic disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with high blood pressure (BP) visit a physician an average of 4 times or more per year in the U.S., yet BP is controlled in fewer than half.  Practical, robust and sustainable models are needed to improve BP in patients  with uncontrolled hypertension. OBJECTIVES: The Home Blood Pressure  Telemonitoring and Case Management to Control Hypertension study (HyperLink) is a  cluster-randomized trial designed to determine whether an intervention that  combines home BP telemonitoring with pharmacist case management improves BP  control compared to usual care at 6 and 12 months in patients with uncontrolled  hypertension. Secondary outcomes are maintenance of BP control at 18 months,  patient satisfaction with their health care, and costs of care. METHODS:  HyperLink enrolled 450 hypertensive patients with uncontrolled BP from 16 primary  care clinics. Eight clinics were randomized to provide usual care (UC) to their  patients (n=222) and 8 were randomized to provide the telemonitoring intervention  (TI) (n=228). TI patients received home BP telemonitors that internally store and  electronically transmit BP data to a secure database. Pharmacist case managers  adjust antihypertensive therapy based on the home BP data under a collaborative  practice agreement with the clinics' primary care teams. The length of the  intervention is 12 months, with follow-up to 18 months to determine the  durability of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: We will test in a real primary care  setting whether combining BP telemonitoring and pharmacist case management can  achieve and maintain high rates of BP control compared to usual care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies of the Medicare Part D coverage gap are limited in generalizability and scope. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the coverage  gap on drugs used for asymptomatic (antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs)  and symptomatic (pain relievers, acid suppressants, and antidepressants)  conditions in elderly patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. DESIGN:  Quasi-experimental study using pre-post design and contemporaneous control group.  SETTING: Medicare claims files from 2005 and 2006 for 5% random sample of  Medicare beneficiaries. PATIENTS: Part D plan enrollees with hypertension or  hyperlipidemia aged 65 years or older who had no coverage, generic-only coverage,  or both brand-name and generic coverage during the gap in 2006. Patients who were  fully eligible for the low-income subsidy served as the control group.  MEASUREMENTS: Monthly 30-day supply prescriptions available, medication  adherence, and continuous medication gaps of 30 days or more for antihypertensive  or lipid-lowering drugs; monthly 30-day supply prescriptions available for pain  relievers, acid suppressants, or antidepressants before and after coverage gap  entry. RESULTS: Patients with no gap coverage had a decrease in monthly  antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drug prescriptions during the coverage gap.  Nonadherence also increased in this group (antihypertensives: odds ratio [OR],  1.60 [95% CI, 1.50 to 1.71]; lipid-lowering drugs: OR, 1.59 [CI, 1.50 to 1.68]).  The proportion of patients with no gap coverage who had continuous medication  gaps in lipid-lowering medication use and antihypertensive use increased by an  absolute 7.3% (OR, 1.38 [CI, 1.29 to 1.46]) and 3.2% (OR, 1.35 [CI, 1.25 to  1.45]), respectively, because of the coverage gap. Decreases in use were smaller  for pain relievers and antidepressants and larger for acid suppressants in  patients with no gap coverage. Patients with generic-only coverage had decreased  use of cardiovascular medications but no change in use of drugs for symptomatic  conditions. No measures changed in the brand-name and generic coverage groups.  Results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main findings.  LIMITATION: Because this study was nonrandomized, unobserved differences may  still exist between study groups. CONCLUSION: The Part D coverage gap was  associated with decreased use of medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  in patients with no gap coverage and generic-only gap coverage. The proposed  phasing out of the gap by 2020 will benefit such patients; however, use of  low-value medications may also increase.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to cardioprotective medications in the year after acute coronary syndrome hospitalization is generally poor and is associated with  increased risk of rehospitalization and mortality. Few interventions have  specifically targeted this high-risk patient population to improve medication  adherence. We hypothesize that a multifaceted patient-centered intervention could  improve adherence to cardioprotective medications. METHODS AND RESULTS: To  evaluate this intervention, we propose enrolling 280 patients with a recent acute  coronary syndrome event into a multicenter randomized, controlled trial. The  intervention comprises 4 main components: (1) pharmacist-led medication  reconciliation and tailoring; (2) patient education; (3) collaborative care  between pharmacist and primary care provider/cardiologist; and (4) 2 types of  voice messaging (educational and medication refill reminder calls). Patients in  the intervention arm will visit with the study pharmacist ≈1 week post-hospital  discharge. The pharmacist will work with the patient and collaborate with  providers to reconcile medication issues. Voice messages will augment the  educational process and remind patients to refill their cardioprotective  medications. The study will compare the intervention versus usual care for 12  months. The primary outcome of interest is adherence using the ReComp method.  Secondary and tertiary outcomes include achievement of targets for blood pressure  and low-density lipoprotein, and reduction in the combined cardiovascular end  points of myocardial infarction hospitalization, coronary revascularization, and  all-cause mortality. Finally, we will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the  intervention compared with usual care. CONCLUSIONS: If the intervention is  effective in improving medication adherence and demonstrating a lower cost, the  intervention has the potential to improve cardiovascular outcomes in this  high-risk patient population.

T2  - Evidence report/technology assessment
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of patient, provider, and systems interventions (Key Question [KQ] 1) or policy interventions (KQ 2) in improving  medication adherence for an array of chronic health conditions. For interventions  that are effective in improving adherence, we then assessed their effectiveness  in improving health, health care utilization, and adverse events. DATA SOURCES:  MEDLINE®, the Cochrane Library. Additional studies were identified from reference  lists and technical experts. REVIEW METHODS: Two people independently selected,  extracted data from, and rated the risk of bias of relevant trials and systematic  reviews. We synthesized the evidence for effectiveness separately for each  clinical condition, and within each condition, by type of intervention. We also  evaluated the prevalence of intervention components across clinical conditions  and the effectiveness of interventions for a range of vulnerable populations. Two  reviewers graded the strength of evidence using established criteria. RESULTS: We  found a total of 62 eligible studies (58 trials and 4 observational studies) from  our review of 3,979 abstracts. These studies included patients with diabetes,  hyperlipidemia, hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, asthma,  depression, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, musculoskeletal diseases, and multiple  chronic conditions. Fifty-seven trials of patient, provider, or systems  interventions (KQ 1) evaluated 20 different types of interventions; 4  observational studies and one trial of policy interventions (KQ 2) evaluated the  effect of reduced out-of-pocket expenses or improved prescription drug coverage.  We found the most consistent evidence of improvement in medication adherence for  interventions to reduce out-of-pocket expenses or improve prescription drug  coverage, case management, and educational interventions across clinical  conditions. Within clinical conditions, we found the strongest support for  self-management of medications for short-term improvement in adherence for asthma  patients; collaborative care or case management programs for short-term  improvement of adherence and to improve symptoms for patients taking depression  medications; and pharmacist-led approaches for hypertensive patients to improve  systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse interventions offer promising  approaches to improving medication adherence for chronic conditions, particularly  for the short term. Evidence on whether these approaches have broad applicability  for clinical conditions and populations is limited, as is evidence regarding  long-term medication adherence or health outcomes.

T2  - Annals of family medicine
AB  - PURPOSE: Recently, there has been dramatic increase in the diagnosis and pharmaceutical management of common chronic illnesses. Using qualitative data  collected in primary care clinics, we assessed how these trends play out in  clinical care. METHODS: This qualitative study focused on management of type 2  diabetes and hypertension in 44 primary care clinics in Michigan and was based on  interviews with 58 clinicians and 70 of their patients, and observations of 107  clinical consultations. We assessed clinicians' treatment strategies and  discussions of factors influencing treatment decisions, and patients'  understandings and experiences in managing these illnesses. RESULTS: Clinicians  focused on helping patients achieve test results recommended by national  guidelines, and most reported combining 2 or more medications per condition to  reach targets. Medication selection and management was the central focus of the  consultations we observed. Polypharmacy was common among patients, with more than  one-half taking 5 or more medications. Patient interviews indicated that heavy  reliance on pharmaceuticals presents challenges to patient well-being, including  financial costs and experiences of adverse health effects. CONCLUSIONS: Factors  promoting heavy use of pharmaceuticals include lower diagnostic and treatment  thresholds, clinician-auditing and reward systems, and the prescribing cascade,  whereby more medications are prescribed to control the effects of  already-prescribed medications. We present a conceptual model, the inverse  benefit law, to provide insight into the impact of pharmaceutical marketing  efforts on the observed trends. We make recommendations about limiting the  influence of the pharmaceutical industry on clinical practice, toward improving  the well-being of patients with chronic illness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated in previous studies that pharmacist management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the outpatient  setting not only improves diabetes-related clinical outcomes such as hemoglobin  A1c but also blood pressure (BP), total cholesterol (TC), and quality of life.  Improved control of BP and TC has been shown to reduce the risks of  cardiovascular disease (CVD), which has placed a heavy economic burden on the  health care system. However, no study has evaluated the cost-effectiveness of  pharmacist intervention programs with respect to the long-term preventive effects  on CVD outcomes among T2DM patients. OBJECTIVES: To (a) quantify the long-term  preventive effects of pharmacist intervention on CVD outcomes among T2DM patients  using evidence from a matched cohort study in the outpatient primary care setting  and (b) assess the relative cost-effectiveness of adding a clinical pharmacist to  the primary care team for the management of patients with T2DM based on  improvement in CVD risks with the aid of an economic model. METHODS: Clinical  data between the periods of June 2007 to February 2010 were collected from  electronic medical records at 2 separate clinics at Kaiser Permanente (KP)  Northern California, 1 with primary care physicians only (control group) and the  other with the addition of a pharmacist (enhanced care group). Patients in the  enhanced care group were matched 1:1 with patients in the control group according  to baseline characteristics that included age, gender, A1c, and Charlson  comorbidity score. The estimated 10-year CVD risk for both groups was calculated  by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine (version 2)  based on age, sex, race, smoking status, atrial fibrillation, duration of  diabetes, levels of A1c, systolic BP (SBP) and TC, and high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (HDL-C) observed at 12 months. There was no statistical difference in  the baseline clinical inputs to the Risk Engine (A1c [P=0.115], SBP [P=0.184], TC  [P=0.055], and HDL-C [P=0.475]) between the 2 groups. A Markov model was  developed to simulate the estimated CVD outcomes over 10 years and to estimate  cost-effectiveness. The final outcomes examined included incremental cost and  effectiveness measured by life years and per quality-adjusted life year gained.  Both deterministic sensitivity analysis (SA) and probabilistic SA were conducted  to examine the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The estimated risks for  coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke (both nonfatal and fatal) at the end of  the follow-up were consistently lower in the enhanced care group compared with  the control group, even though baseline risks in both groups were similar. The  absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the enhanced care and control groups  increased over time. For example, the ARR for nonfatal CHD risk in year 1 was  0.5% (1.2% vs. 0.7%), whereas the ARR increased to 5.5% in year 10 (14.8% vs.  9.3%). Similarly, the ARR between the enhanced care and the control groups was  calculated as 0.3% for fatal CHD in year 1 and increased to 4.6% in year 10.  Results from the Markov model suggest that the enhanced care group was shown to  be a dominant strategy (less expensive and more effective) compared with the  control group in the 10-year evaluation period in the base-case (average or mean  results) scenario. Sensitivity analysis that took into account the uncertainty in  all important variables, such as wage of pharmacists, utility weight (the degree  of preference individuals have for a particular health state or condition),  response rate to pharmacists' care, and uncertainty associated with the estimated  10 years of CVD risk, revealed that the relative value of enhanced care was  robust to most of the variations in these parameters. Notably, the level of  cost-effectiveness measured by net monetary value depends on the time horizon  adopted by the payers and the magnitude of CVD risk reduction. The enhanced care  group has a higher chance of being considered as a cost-effective strategy when a  longer time horizon such as a minimum of 4 to 5 years is adopted. CONCLUSIONS:  Adding pharmacists to the health care management team for diabetic patients  improves the long-term CVD risks. The longer-term CVD risk reductions were shown  to be more dramatic than the short-term reduction. A longer time horizon adopted  by health plans in managing T2DM patients has a higher probability of making the  intervention cost-effective.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Hypertension control for large populations remains a major challenge. OBJECTIVE: To describe a large-scale hypertension program in Northern California  and to compare rates of hypertension control in that program with statewide and  national estimates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The Kaiser Permanente Northern  California (KPNC) hypertension program included a multifaceted approach to blood  pressure control. Patients identified as having hypertension within an integrated  health care delivery system in Northern California from 2001-2009 were included.  The comparison group comprised insured patients in California between 2006-2009  who were included in the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set  (HEDIS) commercial measurement by California health insurance plans participating  in the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) quality measure reporting  process. A secondary comparison group was included to obtain the reported  national mean NCQA HEDIS commercial rates of hypertension control between  2001-2009 from health plans that participated in the NCQA HEDIS quality measure  reporting process. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hypertension control as defined by  NCQA HEDIS. RESULTS: The KPNC hypertension registry included 349,937 patients  when established in 2001 and increased to 652,763 by 2009. The NCQA HEDIS  commercial measurement for hypertension control within KPNC increased from 43.6%  (95% CI, 39.4%-48.6%) to 80.4% (95% CI, 75.6%-84.4%) during the study period  (P < .001 for trend). In contrast, the national mean NCQA HEDIS commercial  measurement increased from 55.4% to 64.1%. California mean NCQA HEDIS commercial  rates of hypertension were similar to those reported nationally from 2006-2009  (63.4% to 69.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults diagnosed with  hypertension, implementation of a large-scale hypertension program was associated  with a significant increase in hypertension control compared with state and  national control rates. Key elements of the program included a comprehensive  hypertension registry, development and sharing of performance metrics,  evidence-based guidelines, medical assistant visits for blood pressure  measurement, and single-pill combination pharmacotherapy.

AB  - Value-based insurance design (VBID) plans selectively lower cost sharing to increase medication adherence. Existing plans have been structured in a variety  of ways, and these variations could influence the effectiveness of VBID plans. We  evaluated seventy-six plans introduced by a large pharmacy benefit manager during  2007-10. We found that after we adjusted for the other features and baseline  trends, VBID plans that were more generous, targeted high-risk patients, offered  wellness programs, did not offer disease management programs, and made the  benefit available only for medication ordered by mail had a significantly greater  impact on adherence than plans without these features. The effects were as large  as 4-5 percentage points. These findings can provide guidance for the structure  of future VBID plans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication adherence is essential to optimizing blood pressure (BP) control. Prior research has demonstrated differences in pharmacy refill patterns  according to antihypertensive drug class. No prior study has assessed the  association between drug class and day-to-day adherence. METHODS: Between 2011  and 2014, we enrolled a convenience sample of 149 patients with persistently  uncontrolled hypertension from two inner-city clinics and concurrently measured  adherence of up to four antihypertensive medications using electronic pillboxes  during the interval between two primary care visits. The main outcome was mean  percent of days adherent to each drug. Mixed effects regression analyses were  used to assess the association between drug class and adherence adjusting for  age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, health insurance, coronary artery  disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, number of medications,  days monitored, and dosing frequency. RESULTS: The mean age was 64 years; 72%  women, 75% Hispanic, 88% prescribed ≥ 1 BP medication. In unadjusted analyses,  adherence was lower for beta-blockers (70.9%) compared to angiotensin receptor  blocking agents (75.0%, P = 0.11), diuretics (75.9%, P < 0.001), calcium channel  blockers (77.6%, P < 0.001) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (78.0%,  P < 0.0001). In the adjusted analysis, only dosing frequency (P = 0.0001) but not  drug class (P = 0.71) was associated with medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS:  Antihypertensive drug class was not associated with electronically measured  adherence after accounting for dosing frequency amongst patients with  uncontrolled hypertension. Low adherence to beta-blockers may have been due to  the common practice of prescribing multiple daily dosing. Providers may consider  using once daily formulations to optimize adherence and should assess adherence  among all treated patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many hypertensive patients discontinue drug therapy despite the increased cardiovascular risk associated with inadequately controlled hypertension. However, most experiments do not address this premature discontinuation of therapy, making it difficult to project the appropriateness of antihypertensive drugs in real-world use. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess patients' persistence with antihypertensive drug therapy in a nonexperimental setting. METHODS: An administrative database kept by the Local Health Unit of Ravenna, Ravenna, Italy, listing patient baseline characteristics, drug prescriptions, and hospital admissions was used to perform a population-based, retrospective study. The study included all patients who met the following criteria from January I through December 31, 1997: new user of antihypertensive drugs; > or = 20 years of age; receiving a first prescription for a diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin II-receptor antagonist (AIIA), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. All prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs filled during the 12-month follow-up period were used to define patients as continuers, switchers, or discontinuers on the basis of their persistence with therapy. RESULTS: A total of 16,783 patients were included in the study analyses: 7,409 men (44.1%) and 9,374 women (55.9%), with an average age of 56.1 +/- 18.3 years (range, 20-105 years). Of this study population, 64.9% (n = 10,894) discontinued treatment over the course of follow-up, 26.9% (n = 4508) continued treatment with the initially prescribed medication (with 5.1% [n = 862] adding another medication for combination therapy), and 8.2% (n = 1381) switched medications. Patients initially prescribed AIIAs were more likely to continue treatment than those initiated on other types of antihypertensives (P < 0.001). Discontinuation was associated with younger age, lower prevalence of concurrent chronic pharmacotherapies, and lower prevalence of previous hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Health care claims data are a powerful tool for measuring continuation of therapy, providing detailed, populationwide epidemiologic and economic information for analyzing antihypertensive drug treatment. Further studies are required to relate pharmacotherapy to outcomes.

The incidence and prevalence of hypertension are rising even among young people in both urban as well as rural communities. Although various conventional therapeutic moieties are available for the management of hypertension, they have serious flaws such as hepatic metabolism, reduced dose frequency, poor aqueous solubility, reduced bioavailability, and increased adverse effects, making the drug therapy ineffective. Therefore, it is required to design a novel drug delivery system having the capability to solve the constraints associated with conventional treatment of hypertension. Nanotechnology is a new way of using and manipulating the matter at the molecular level, whose functional organization is measured in nanometers. The applications of nanotechnology in the field of medicine provide an alternative and novel direction for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and show excellent performance in the field of targeted drug therapy. Various nanotechnologies based drug delivery systems, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanosuspension, nanoemulsion, liposome, self-emulsifying systems, and polymeric nanoparticles, are available. Among them, nanoemulsion has provided a niche to supplement currently available therapeutic choices due to numerous benefits like stability, ease of preparation, enhanced drug absorption, reduced hepatic metabolism, increased dose frequency, enhanced bioavailability, and encapsulation of hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic drugs. This present review provides an in-depth idea about progression in treatment of hypertension, constraints for antihypertensive drug therapy, need of nanoemulsions to overcome these constraints, comparative analysis of nanoemulsions over other nanostructure drug delivery systems, pharmacodynamics studies of nanoemulsions for treatment of hypertension, recent patents for drug-loaded nanoemulsions meant for hypertension, and marketed formulations of nanoemulsions for hypertension.

AB  - Purpose. The implementation and outcomes of a program combining electronic home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) and pharmacist-provided medication therapy management (MTM) services in a renal transplantation clinic are described. Summary. Patients enrolled in the program were provided with a computer-enabled blood pressure monitor. A dedicated renal transplantation pharmacist was integrated into the renal transplantation team under a collaborative care practice agreement. The collaborative care agreement allowed the pharmacist to authorize medication additions, deletions, and dosage changes. Comprehensive disease and blood pressure education was provided by a clinical pharmacist. In the pretrans-plantation setting, the pharmacist interviewed the renal transplant candidate and documents allergies, verified the patient's medication profile, and identified and assessed barriers to medication adherence. A total of 50 renal transplant recipients with at least one recorded home blood pressure reading and at least one year of follow-up were included in our analysis. A significant reduction in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were observed at 30, 90,180, and 360 days after enrollment in the program (p < 0.05). Pharmacist interventions were documented for 37 patients. Medication-related problems accounted for 46% of these interventions and included dosage modifications, regimen changes, and mitigation of barriers to medication access and adherence. Conclusion. Implementation of electronic HBPM and pharmacist-provided MTM services implemented in a renal transplant clinic was associated with sustained improvements in blood pressure control. Incorporation of a pharmacist in the renal transplant clinic resulted in the detection and resolution of medication-related problems.

AB  - PURPOSE: Adherence patterns of patients treated with a fixed-dose combination of amlodipine--benazepril versus an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocker (CCB) prescribed as separate drugs were studied. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of pharmacy claims from a managed care organization in the northeastern United States, patients who received at least two prescriptions for fixed-dose amlodipine-benazepril (n = 2839) or at least two prescriptions for an ACE inhibitor plus a dihydropyridine CCB (n = 3367) were followed over one year. Adherence, defined as the medication possession ratio (MPR), was calculated based on daily possession of the prescribed drug or drugs over the study period. To estimate the impact of overall drug burden on adherence to antihypertensive therapy, concomitant medication use was calculated as the number of American Hospital Formulary Service (AHFS) drug classes prescribed. RESULTS: Adherence rates among patients receiving fixed-dose amlodipine--benazepril versus an ACE inhibitor plus a dihydropyridine CCB were 87.9% and 69.2%, respectively (p < 0.0001) over a mean follow-up of 259 and 247 days, respectively. Patients received a mean 4.0 major AHFS drug classes in the amlodipine-benazepril group and 5.2 in the ACE inhibitor plus dihydropyridine CCB group. As the number of concomitant drugs increased, the difference in the MPR between the two treatment groups increased in favor of fixed-dose amlodipine-benazepril. CONCLUSION: Fixed-dose amlodipine-benazepril was associated with higher adherence rates versus an ACE inhibitor plus a dihydropyridine CCB taken as two separate tablets, regardless of the number of concomitant medications prescribed.

AB  - Background: The impact of pharmacist-led transition of care services with collaborative drug therapy management has shown to improve patients' outcomes and decrease health costs. Compelling statistics show higher readmission rates for under-insured patients compared with insured patients at primary health care clinics. Methods: This is a single center, prospective, cohort study designed to examine team-based collaborative drug therapy management and its effect on therapeutic outcomes of under-insured patients with target chronic diseases managed in a primary health center. Targeted chronic diseases included dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, anticoagulation disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure. The primary outcome measures included percentage of time in therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) and percentage of patients at targeted goals of blood pressure, lipids, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes included reduced emergency department visits, number of patient encounters, hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge, and disease exacerbation rates. Results: Patients were at INR goal 58% of the time compared with 52% at baseline (P =.66). There was a 9% improvement in mean HbA1c in the intervention group when compared with baseline (9.6% vs 10.9%, P =.03). With pharmacist intervention, 73.8% of the patients had their blood pressure at goal compared with 50% at baseline (P =.14). A limited number of patients were readmitted for different reasons, including uncontrolled disease states. Conclusions: The pharmacist-physician collaborative drug therapy management led to improved blood pressure control, average HbA1c, and time in therapeutic INR range. A decrease in health care utilization was also identified.

TI  - Blood pressure management: individualized treatment based on absolute risk and the potential for benefit.
AU  - Alderman, Michael H.
AU  - Alderman, M H
T2  - Annals of Internal Medicine
AB  - Clinical practice often conflicts with epidemiologic evidence in the management of blood pressure. Antihypertensive therapy is generally prescribed if blood pressure exceeds some arbitrary level, thus committing many persons with minimal cardiovascular risk to long-term drug therapy. By contrast, below that level, regardless of cardiovascular risk, blood pressure reduction is rarely sought. Epidemiologic data, however, consistently show a continuous, positive, linear relationship of the height of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with the incidence of stroke and heart attack. No threshold level distinguishes those who will have a cardiovascular event from those who will not. In fact, most heart attacks and many strokes occur among persons with "normal" blood pressures. Observational experience suggests that benefit could be obtained from universal blood pressure reduction of even a few millimeters of mercury. This public health strategy can be augmented by identifying those individuals, at every level of blood pressure, whose risk for cardiovascular disease justifies the cost of pharmacologic intervention. Antihypertensive drug therapy will be most efficient and effective if directed at those who, by virtue of their constellation of risk factors or evidence of preclinical vascular disease, are likely to have a heart attack or stroke. The resulting redirection of clinical resources will spare many hypertensive persons whose absolute risk for a cardiovascular event is small, from life-long treatment. At the same time, other persons, currently classified as normotensive, will become candidates for blood pressure reduction because their cardiovascular risk is high.

Total health expenditures per person were measured for a 1-year period before and after enrolling patients in MTM services.Results: 637 drug therapy problems were resolved among 285 intervention patients, and the percentage of patients' goals of therapy achieved increased from 76% to 90%. HEDIS measures improved in the intervention group compared with the comparison group for hypertension (71% versus 59%) and cholesterol management (52% versus 30%). Total health expenditures decreased from $11,965 to $8,197 per person (n = 186, P < 0.0001). The reduction in total annual health expenditures exceeded the cost of providing MTM services by more than 12 to 1.Conclusion: Patients receiving face-to-face MTM services provided by pharmacists in collaboration with prescribers experienced improved clinical outcomes and lower total health expenditures. Clinical outcomes of MTM services have chronic care improvement and value-based purchasing implications, and economic outcomes support inclusion of MTM services in health plan design.

AB  - Objective: This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine as monotherapy and in combination therapy in patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite pharmacologic treatment.Methods: This observational, open, prospective, parallel, controlled, multicenter, comparative, postmarketing drug surveillance study included hypertensive outpatients (systolic blood pressure [SBP] >/= 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] >/= 90 mm Hg) whose hypertension was uncontrolled despite pharmacologic treatment. Randomly selected primary care physicians chose the patients and assigned them to the group (amlodipine monotherapy or amlodipine as part of a 2-drug antihypertensive regimen) they considered more appropriate. Each patient was to have >/= 3 visits during the 4-month follow-up period. The initial dosage of amlodipine was 5 mg once daily; this dosage could be increased to 10 mg once daily to achieve control of hypertension. Main outcome measures included optimum and suboptimum control of hypertension and incidence of adverse events.Results: A total of 2628 patients (1838 [69.9%], amlodipine monotherapy; 790 [30.1%], combination therapy) participated in this study. Of these patients, 2406 had DBP >/= 90 mm Hg at baseline. Only 29 patients had DBP > 90 mm Hg and SBP < 140 mm Hg. By the end of the study, 28.6% of the 2442 patients for whom data were available had achieved the optimum therapeutic goal (SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg). A total of 156 patients (5.9%) experienced adverse events, 93.0% mild (edema, headache, flushing) and 7.0% serious. In 78.3% of cases the prescribing physician considered the adverse event to be related to treatment, but none of the 13 serious adverse events in 11 patients were considered to be related to amlodipine. No significant difference in the incidence of adverse events was found between the patients receiving monotherapy and those receiving combination therapy. A significantly higher percentage of nondiabetic patients than diabetic patients experienced optimum control (P < 0.05).Conclusions: Amlodipine appears to be a well-tolerated and effective antihypertensive drug for use in monotherapy or a combination regimen in patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite pharmacologic treatment. Because the maximum dose (10 mg once daily) was not required in most patients and because combination therapy was often not needed, amlodipine may be a low-cost option for the treatment of hypertension.

TI  - Economic impact of switching to fixed-dose combination therapy for Japanese hypertensive patients: a retrospective cost analysis.
AU  - Akazawa, Manabu
AU  - Fukuoka, Katsushi
T2  - BMC Health Services Research
AB  - Background: The prescription of fixed-dose combinations (FDC) of antihypertensive drugs has increased rapidly since the relaxation of the prescription-term restriction. In this study, we used the opportunity of this policy change in Japan as an instrument to assess the causal impact of switching to FDC on hypertensive treatment costs.Methods: Claims data from 64 community pharmacies located in Tokyo were used to identify hypertensive patients under continuous treatment with angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). Patients switching to FDC between December 2010 and April 2011 were compared to patients who did not receive FDC (control group). Changes in annual antihypertensive drug costs were compared using a difference-in-differences approach to adjust for patient characteristics and use of concomitant medication. Subpopulation analyses were also performed, taking into account pre-index treatment patterns and prescribers' characteristics.Results: There were 542 patients who switched to FDC and 9664 patients in the control group. No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups, except for antihypertensive drug use patterns before the policy change and prescribers' characteristics. The switch to FDC was associated with an annual saving of 10,420 yen (US$112.0) in antihypertensive drug costs. Approximately 20% of the FDC patients, however, switched from ARB alone, and their drug costs increased by 2376 yen (US$25.5).Conclusions: For hypertensive patients who required ARB-based combination therapy, switching to FDC drugs had a significant cost-saving effect. However, the policy change of relaxing the prescription-term restriction could encourage aggressive treatment, i.e., switching to a combination therapy from monotherapy, regardless of medical conditions. Further research is required to evaluate the possible negative aspects of FDC drugs.

AB  - Context: Poor medication adherence diminishes the health benefits of pharmacotherapies. Elderly patients with coronary risk factors frequently require treatment with multiple medications, placing them at increased risk for nonadherence.Objective: To test the efficacy of a comprehensive pharmacy care program to improve medication adherence and its associated effects on blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).Design, Setting, and Patients: A multiphase, prospective study with an observational phase and a randomized controlled trial conducted at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center of 200 community-based patients aged 65 years or older taking at least 4 chronic medications. The study was conducted from June 2004 to August 2006.Intervention: After a 2-month run-in phase (measurement of baseline adherence, BP, and LDL-C), patients entered a 6-month intervention phase (standardized medication education, regular follow-up by pharmacists, and medications dispensed in time-specific packs). Following the intervention phase, patients were randomized to continued pharmacy care vs usual care for an additional 6 months.Main Outcome Measures: Primary end point of the observation phase was change in the proportion of pills taken vs baseline; secondary end points were the associated changes in BP and LDL-C. Primary end point of the randomization phase was the between-group comparison of medication persistence.Results: A total of 200 elderly patients (77.1% men; mean [SD] age, 78 [8.3] years), taking a mean (SD) of 9 (3) chronic medications were enrolled. Coronary risk factors included drug-treated hypertension in 184 patients (91.5%) and drug-treated hyperlipidemia in 162 (80.6%). Mean (SD) baseline medication adherence was 61.2% (13.5%). After 6 months of intervention, medication adherence increased to 96.9% (5.2%; P<.001) and was associated with significant improvements in systolic BP (133.2 [14.9] to 129.9 [16.0] mm Hg; P = .02) and LDL-C (91.7 [26.1] to 86.8 [23.4] mg/dL; P = .001). Six months after randomization, the persistence of medication adherence decreased to 69.1% (16.4%) among those patients assigned to usual care, whereas it was sustained at 95.5% (7.7%) in pharmacy care (P<.001). This was associated with significant reductions in systolic BP in the pharmacy care group (-6.9 mm Hg; 95% CI, -10.7 to -3.1 mm Hg) vs the usual care group (-1.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, -5.9 to 3.9 mm Hg; P = .04), but no significant between-group differences in LDL-C levels or reductions.Conclusions: A pharmacy care program led to increases in medication adherence, medication persistence, and clinically meaningful reductions in BP, whereas discontinuation of the program was associated with decreased medication adherence and persistence.Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00393419

AB  - Objective: To evaluate treatment of mild hypertension using combinations of diet and low-dose pharmacologic therapies.Design: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.Setting: Three university-based tertiary care centers.Patients: Patients (697) 21 to 65 years of age with diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 100 mm Hg as well as weight between 110% and 160% of ideal weight.Intervention: Patients were stratified by clinical center and race and were randomly assigned to one of three diets (usual, low-sodium and high-potassium, weight loss) and one of three agents (placebo, chlorthalidone, and atenolol).Measurements: Changes in measures of sexual problems, distress, and well-being after 6 months of therapy were analyzed.Main Results: Low-dose chlorthalidone and atenolol produced few side effects, except in men. Erection-related problems worsened in 28% (95% CI, 15% to 41%) of men receiving chlorthalidone and usual diet compared with 3% (CI, 0% to 9%) of those receiving placebo and usual diet (P = 0.009) and 11% (CI, 2% to 20%) of those receiving atenolol and usual diet (P greater than 0.05). The weight loss diet ameliorated this effect. The low-sodium diet with placebo was associated with greater fatigue (34%; CI, 23% to 45%) than was either usual diet (18%; CI, 10% to 27%; P = 0.04) or weight reduction (15%; CI, 7% to 23%; P = 0.009). The low-sodium diet with chlorthalidone increased problems with sleep (32%; CI, 22% to 42%) compared with chlorthalidone and usual diet (16%; CI, 8% to 24%; P = 0.04). The weight loss diet benefited quality of life most, reducing total physical complaints (P less than 0.001) and increasing satisfaction with health (P less than 0.001). Total physical complaints decreased in 57% to 76% of patients depending on drug and diet group, and were markedly decreased by weight loss.Conclusion: In general, low-dose antihypertensive drug therapy (with chlorthalidone or atenolol) improves rather than impairs the quality of life; however, chlorthalidone with usual diet increases sexual problems in men.

AB  - PURPOSE: Verification of whether pharmacotherapeutic follow-up improves arterial blood pressure (BP) was conducted, and whether this improvement alters the quality of life of patients with resistant hypertension in a university teaching hospital in Brazil was determined. METHODS: A prospective survey of 44 patients was carried out over a period of 20 months. Each patient was followed up for 12 months. Pharmaceutical care was assessed using the following methods: measurement of the office BP and ambulatory BP monitoring, adherence to therapy, drug-related problems, and the use of health care facilities (urgent care visits and hospital admissions). The health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of patients was also assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and a physical symptoms profile. RESULTS: The majority (95.5%) of patients adhered to the treatment throughout the study, and there was a significant reduction in BP (p < 0.05). Nearly all of the domains of HRQOL assessed by SF-36 remained unchanged during the follow-up except for a significant improvement in social functioning (p = 0.041). There was a significant reduction in moderate and severe physical symptoms (p = 0.005). There were also significant reductions in the number of urgent care visits (p = 0.0001) and hospital admissions (p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: The pharmaceutical care provided by a pharmacist in an ambulatory care clinic in Brazil improved BP, adherence to antihypertensive medications, and the social functioning of patients with resistant hypertension.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of benefit design change (BDC) on medication adherence and persistence (including switch in therapy), drug costs, and total healthcare costs. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study was performed using administrative claims data from an integrated healthcare system between January 2001 and December 2002. METHODS: Continuously enrolled patients in 2001 and 2002 with allergic rhinitis, asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or osteoarthritis belonged to employer groups with or without a pharmacy BDC as of January 1, 2002. Prescription status (same, switch, or discontinue), adherence among patients receiving therapy, and differences in drug costs and total healthcare costs for each disease state were measured between groups. Bivariate and multivariate statistics were used to test differences in outcomes between groups. RESULTS: Compared with the group without BDC, the proportion of patients who discontinued drug therapy was significantly greater in the BDC group among those with allergic rhinitis (67% vs 54%), asthma (66% vs 50%), osteoarthritis (61% vs 36%), and hypertension (39% vs 18%) (P < .05 for all). Medication compliance was not affected by BDC. The year-to-year pharmacy costs per patient in the BDC group decreased $305 for patients with osteoarthritis (P < .001) and $95 for patients with allergic rhinitis (P = .03). There was no significant effect on overall healthcare costs in any disease state during the year following the BDC. CONCLUSION: A pharmacy BDC may result in decreased pharmacy costs, with no effect on overall healthcare costs within 1 year for patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, hypertension, or osteoarthritis.

AB  - Background: Hypertension is one of the leading risk factors for ischemic heart diseases, and high rates of hypertension prevalence have either remained the same or increased in developing countries in recent years. Unfortunately, about 20% to 50% of patients with chronic diseases have been nonadherent to their drug therapy. SMS text messaging and pharmacy student-led consultations have the potential to help patients manage their blood pressure (BP).Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of SMS text messaging and consultation to manage the BP of Chinese patients with hypertension.Methods: We conducted a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial among patients with hypertension in Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, China, and recruited 384 patients from 8 community health care centers. Patients were randomized into an intervention group to receive SMS text messages and consultations or into a control group to receive usual care for 3 months. We sent SMS text messages at 3-day intervals and collected data at baseline (including demographics, clinical outcomes, medication complexity, side effects, patient behavior, knowledge about hypertension, BP, and medication adherence) and the 3-month follow-up (including BP, medication adherence, and knowledge about hypertension).Results: We assessed 445 patients with hypertension and excluded 61 patients who were not eligible or who had not filled out their questionnaires. The mean age of the patients was 68.5 (SD 7.9) years in the intervention group and 69.4 (SD 9.7) years in the control group, and the sample was primarily female (265/384, 69.0%). Patients in the intervention group showed significant improvements in systolic BP (SBP; mean 134.5 mm Hg, SD 15.5 mm Hg vs mean 140.7 mm Hg, SD 15.2 mm Hg; P=.001), medication adherence (mean 7.4, SD 1.2 vs mean 7.0, SD 1.3; P=.04), and knowledge about hypertension (mean 6.3, SD 0.9 vs mean 5.9, SD 1.2; P=.004) compared with those in the control group. In measures of diastolic BP (DBP), the two arms showed nonsignificant improvements (mean 78.2 mm Hg, SD 9.0 mm Hg vs mean 77.2 mm Hg, SD 10.3 mm Hg; P=.06). In total, 176 patients had controlled BP at the 3-month follow-up (98 patients in the intervention group vs 78 patients in the control group), but it was nonsignificant (P=.08).Conclusions: The use of SMS text messaging and consultation to manage SBP and improve medication adherence is effective, feasible, and acceptable among Chinese patients with hypertension, although a significant difference was not observed with regard to DBP. It is important to maximize the potential of SMS text messaging and consultation by increasing the feasibility and acceptance of mobile interventions and conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis on this method.Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR1900026862; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=42717.

T2  - Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between blood pressure and medication adherence using electronic pillboxes (MEMS). SETTING: Five general practices in Bristol, UK. SUBJECTS: A total of 239 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of hypertension and being prescribed at least one blood pressure-lowering medication. Participants were asked to use the electronic pillbox as their drug bottle for at least one month. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 'Timing adherence' (correct inter-dose intervals) as measured through MEMS and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) office blood pressure. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) timing adherence was 88% (+/-17),>80% in 175 (73%), and less than 50% in 11 (5%) participants. Adherence was monitored for a mean of 33 (+/-6) days. Mean (+/-SD) SBP was 147.9+/-19.1 mmHg and DBP 82.3+/-10.1 mmHg. There was no evidence to suggest that timing adherence was associated with SBP or DBP (overall correlation coefficients -0.01 and -0.02 respectively). According to current guidelines, about one in four of all participants had controlled SBP (only 6% of diabetic patients). DBP was under control in 66% of the individuals. CONCLUSIONS: No relationship between adherence and blood pressure in patients with hypertension recruited from primary care was found. Average timing adherence measured by electronic monitors was high (88%) and blood pressure was controlled in a minority of patients. Our findings suggest that in terms of poor blood pressure control pharmacological non-response to or insufficient intensity of blood pressure-lowering medication might be more important than poor adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the clinical and humanistic outcomes of a community pharmacist-involved collaborative care model in diabetes management.Methods: This was a parallel arm, open-label, multi-centre randomized controlled trial conducted over 6 months. Subjects with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c ≥ 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and taking ≥ 5 medications were included. Participants were randomized into intervention (collaborative care) and control groups (physician-centric care). The intervention included medication therapy management and telephonic follow-up with visits to family physicians, nurses, and dietitians. Clinical outcomes included changes in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure (SBP), lipids, and hypoglycaemic incidences. Humanistic outcomes included self-care capabilities and quality of life. Linear mixed models were constructed. Intention-to-treat analyses, with sensitivity analyses, were conducted.Results: A total of 264 participants were randomized (intervention: 131, control: 133). Significantly greater reduction in HbA1c was observed in the intervention group (intervention: -0.32% (-3.52 mmol/mol) vs. control: -0.06% (-0.66 mmol/mol), p = 0.038). Changes in SBP, lipids, and incidences of hypoglycaemia were not significant over 6 months between both groups. Significantly greater improvements in self-management (p < 0.001) and quality of life (p = 0.003) were observed within the intervention group.Conclusion: Partnering community pharmacists in a collaborative care team improved glycaemic control, quality of life and self-care capabilities of patients with diabetes and polypharmacy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease worldwide, constituting one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aims of this study were to evaluate the level of awareness and control of hypertension comparing sex, socioeconomic and educational level, BMI and drug therapy in over 40-year-old patients. The cost-effectiveness of the main pharmacologic classes of antihypertensives, as monotherapy and combination therapy, was also assessed. METHODS: In this randomized and cross-sectional populational study, a sample of 738 hypertensive adults with ages at least 40 years were evaluated. Of these, 345 (46.7%) were men and 393 (53.3%) were women. RESULTS: A total of 72.9% of the hypertensives knew about their disease. Women in the 40-49 and 50-59 age groups and obese individuals had a higher rate of awareness of their hypertensive status. The rates of awareness were similar in different social classes and educational levels, however, blood pressure control varied. beta-Blockers were the most effective drugs to control blood pressure with no differences being observed between monotherapy and combinations. Diuretics were the most cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the participants received monotherapy. The best percentage of control with monotherapy was obtained with beta-blockers but the diuretics treatment was the most cost-effective. The levels of awareness and control were high compared with developed countries, most evident in the higher social classes and higher education levels.

AB  - Background: Adherence to medication is a critical factor in the continued health and well-being of patients with hypertension. Patients' acceptance of medical advice and information may be influenced by their subjective beliefs about their health condition; therefore, it is essential that their beliefs be taken into account when giving health advice or medical treatment.Objective: To determine whether a relationship exists between illness attribution, perceived control, and adherence to antihypertensive medications.Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional survey of hypertensive patients was conducted at the University of Michigan Medical Centers, Hypertension Clinic, Ann Arbor, MI. One hundred two patients with a goal to reduce their blood pressure were included in the study. Written and follow-up telephone survey questions assessing patients' illness attributions, perceived control, and medication adherence were administered. Associations between these variables were analyzed using correlation analyses.Results: The majority of patients (67.7%) were adherent with their hypertensive medications. Patients indicated that modifiable variables were the most common attribution believed to cause hypertension; however, there was no significant relationship to medication adherence. A significant inverse relationship was found between perceived control over hypertension and medication adherence (p < 0.01).Conclusions: The findings suggest that patients' greater perception of control over trying to reduce blood pressure may result in decreased reliance on medications and subsequent nonadherence to drug therapy. Implications of these findings on pharmacy practice are discussed.

AB  - What is known and Objective There is conclusive evidence demonstrating that formulary restrictions are associated with reduced utilization and pharmacy spending of the restricted drugs. However, prior efforts to implement restrictive formularies have been associated with inconsistent rates of therapy discontinuation and mixed impacts on adherence to therapy. Also, the impact of transferring patients from an already restrictive formulary to a more aggressive model has not been previously examined. This study evaluated the impact of implementation of a more restrictive formulary on therapy disruption, adherence rates, pharmacy costs and generic utilization among patients with common chronic conditions. Methods In 2014, CVS Health implemented Value Formulary ( VF), a restrictive benefit design with the aim of reducing spending while preserving access to and adherence to essential therapy, was used. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess changes in therapy disruption rates, pharmacy costs and generic dispensing rate ( GDR) (for continuers) and medication adherence (for initiators) following the implementation of VF. The study group was selected from members of three existing employer clients transitioned from standard formulary ( SF) to VF on January 2014. The control population was a matched group of six employers with the same preperiod formulary structure, business unit, adherence programmes and patient out-of-pocket cost as the study group. The control group retained SF in 2014. To assess therapy disruption after VF implementation, we categorized patients by their subsequent medication use into three groups: (i) therapy stopped, (ii) therapy continued and (iii) therapy switched. Medication adherence was measured as monthly proportion of days covered ( PDC). Pharmacy cost and GDR were measured per utilizer per month ( PUPM). Rates of therapy disruption in study and control groups were compared using the chi-square test. Differences in monthly PDC between matched groups were evaluated using multivariate linear regression. Impact of VF on pharmacy cost and GDR was measured through segmented regression of interrupted time series data with generalized estimating equations. Results and discussion A transition from SF to VF influenced drug coverage for approximately 13% of members (as their medications were either no longer covered, or covered restrictively under VF). Compared to patients whose plan sponsors retained SF, the patients that transitioned to VF had a modest (1·3%) but statistically significant increase in therapy discontinuation rates. This was offset by similarly modest improvements in adherence; patients who initiated therapy under VF demonstrated a 1·5% higher adherence to medications as compared to SF patients ( P < 0·001). Medication costs in the VF group were lower by $20 PUPM ( P < 0·001), and GDR was greater by 4·2% ( P < 0·001). What is new and Conclusion Transition of patients to a more restrictive drug formulary led to modest therapy discontinuation, similarly modest improvements in medication adherence and substantial prescription drug cost savings. As healthcare payors search for ways to control the rapid rise in spending for medications without compromising quality, the Value Formulary can serve as a useful tool.

T2  - Journal of the American Pharmacists Association: JAPhA
AB  - Background: Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease in the United States and is costing the health care system billions of dollars annually. A health program that combines education, empowerment, and monitoring has shown to improve clinical outcomes and decrease overall health care costs.Objective: To describe the implementation and effectiveness of a self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) program in a community pharmacy.Practice Description: An independent community pharmacy located within rural Southeast Missouri. On-site community pharmacists provide medication therapy management, adherence monitoring, immunizations, and reimbursed clinical services.Practice Innovation: Patients were eligible if they were older than 18 years of age and fell into one of the following categories: self-reported a new hypertension diagnosis, self-reported a desire to SMBP, were referred by a provider, or had a medication change within the 3 months before enrollment. The program consisted of 4 patient sessions. The first session obtained an initial blood pressure and provided patient education and behavior counseling. Follow-up sessions obtained average SMBP readings and reinforced previously learned concepts.Evaluation Methods: Implementation was evaluated using time and patient satisfaction. Effectiveness was evaluated using number and type of clinical problems identified, BP measurements, and test scores.Results: A total of 20 patients enrolled and completed the study. The program took 63 minutes (SD ± 18) of staff time per patient for recruitment, sessions, reminder calls, and documentation. All patients received education and monitoring and 11 additional clinical problems were documented. Systolic BP decreased an average of 17 mm Hg (P = 0.002), and diastolic BP decreased an average of 12 mm Hg (P < 0.001). Patient confidence scores increased by 14%, and 7 more patients correctly answered the post-test knowledge question. All patients reported overall satisfaction with the program as "satisfied" or "very satisfied."Conclusion: This standardized SMBP program effectively improved hypertension control and patient confidence in managing BP.

AB  - Introduction: Appropriate management of chronic diseases, including proper use of medications, can lead to better disease control, decrease disease-related complications, and improve overall health. Pharmacists have been shown to positively affect chronic disease outcomes through medication therapy management (MTM). The primary objectives of this project are to increase the number of patients with (1) A1c in control and (2) blood pressure in control; secondary objectives are to (3) describe number and type of medication-related problems identified and resolved by pharmacists providing MTM in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), (4) identify potential (pADEs) and actual adverse drug events (ADEs), and refer patients to diabetes self-management education classes, as needed. Methods: This multisite, prospective, descriptive pilot study engaged three FQHC sites with distinct models of established pharmacist MTM services to care for patients with uncontrolled diabetes and/or hypertension. Data were reported in aggregate regarding primary and secondary outcomes. Results: As of December 2015, 706 patients were enrolled in the project. Of the 422 with uncontrolled diabetes, 52.84% (n = 223) had an A1c <9%; 72 patients (17.06%) achieved an A1c between 8% and 9%, 19.19% (n = 81) of patients achieved an A1c <8% and ≥7%, and 16.59% (n = 70) of patients achieved an A1c <7%. The percentage of patients with blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg improved to 65.21%. Conclusion: Pharmacist-provided MTM can improve chronic disease intermediate outcomes for medically underserved patients in FQHCs.

AB  - : The prevalence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) and the metabolic syndrome continues to increase in Latin America, while the rates of diagnosis, treatment and control of these disorders remain low. The frequency of the risk factors that constitute the metabolic syndrome and are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease has not diminished since the publication of the previous consensus. This document discusses the socioeconomic, demographic, environmental and cultural characteristics of most associated Latin American countries and partially explains the lack of better results in improving clinical and public health actions that allow high morbidity and mortality rates caused by cardiovascular diseases and DM2 to be reduced through programs aligned with the so-called precision medicine, which should be predictive, preventive, personalized and participatory. The Consensus ratifies the diagnostic criteria expressed in the previous consensus to define hypertension and DM2 but, for the metabolic syndrome, and in the absence of evidence, the recommendation is to implement a cohort study that determines the abdominal perimeter value associated with hard outcomes, such as DM2 and CVD. Meanwhile, we recommend modifying the criterion to more than 94 cm in men and more than 84 cm in women according to WHO recommendations. We also recommend the carrying out of a study that identifies the situation of hypertension and DM2 in people of African ancestry who, in Latin America, exceed 75 million and whose epidemiology does not include solid studies. With respect to the proposed therapeutic targets, we recommended maintaining those defined in the previous consensus, but insisting that early pharmacological management of prediabetes with metformin should be introduced, as should the treatment of diabetic hypertensive patients with a combination therapy of two fixed-dose antihypertensive drugs and management with statins. To increase adherence, the use of different drugs combined in a single pill (polypill) is recommended. The simplification of the therapeutic regimen is accompanied by greater control of cardiovascular risk factors, both in primary and secondary prevention, and has been shown to be cost-effective. The consensus recommends the use of the currently available polypill combining an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a statin and aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention and in patients with a high cardiovascular risk, such as hypertension patients with DM2.

AB  - The authors investigated the efficacy of a lifestyle educational program, organized in small group meetings, in improving the outcome of a nonpharmacologic intervention. One hundred and eighty-eight hypertensive patients with stable blood pressure (BP) levels and drug therapy in the previous 6 months were randomly divided into educational care (EC) and usual care (UC) groups. They were followed at 3-month intervals up to 2 years. In addition to the visits in an outpatient clinic, patients in the EC program participated in small group meetings in order to improve their knowledge of the disease and reinforce their motivation for treatment. At baseline, EC and UC groups were similar for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) levels, and pharmacologic treatment. Patients in the EC group had significantly reduced total energy, total and saturated fats, and sodium intake. Physical activity was significantly increased in the EC group as well. At the end of the 1-year follow-up, BMI (P<.001), visceral fat (P<.001), and BP (P<.001) were significantly lower in the EC group compared with the UC group. Pharmacologic treatment during the study was similar for all classes of drugs apart from diuretics whose dose was higher in the UC group at the end of the study.

TI  - Metabolic Syndrome Monitoring: Efficacy of an Educational Intervention on Knowledge, Attitude and Monitoring Behaviors of Outpatient Psychiatric Providers...28th Annual Scientific Session, June 2-6, 2017, Baltimore, Maryland.
AU  - McNeil, Myrto
T2  - Nursing Research
AB  - Background/Purpose: Individuals treated with second-generation antipsychotic agents, including olanzapine, clozapine, quetiapine and risperidone, for the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic symptoms, are at higher risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Empirical evidence established atypical antipsychotic-induced metabolic disturbances as a disturbing trend in clinical settings leading to various medical complications and premature death with a prevalence at least five times higher in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia compared to healthy subjects. Despite recommendations by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), pharmaceutical agencies, and experts in the study of obesity and diabetes, the monitoring of metabolic events is not standardized practice among providers. A provider-focused intervention developed to promote a guideline-based metabolic monitoring protocol was implemented in an outpatient psychiatric clinic. The principal investigator expects improvement in psychiatric providers' knowledge of metabolic syndrome criteria, attitude towards metabolic monitoring and frequency of metabolic monitoring, following the educational intervention. The specific aims of this project are to promote best practice, reduce poor health outcomes, and decrease healthcare costs in the delivery of care for patients chronically medicated with atypical antipsychotic agents. Theoretical Framework: A pre and post-test quality improvement design using The Iowa Model of Evidence-Based Practice to Promote Quality Care framework guided the implementation a provider-focused educational intervention on metabolic syndrome monitoring. Methods: A baseline assessment was obtained through providers' self-report of knowledge, attitude and monitoring practice by means of an 18-item questionnaire. The investigator concurrently conducted a baseline retrospective chart review (N=30) to evaluate monitoring practices- collected data included subjects' family/patient history, blood pressure, weight, waist circumference, fasting lipid panel and fasting blood glucose. Secondly, an educational intervention was implemented in a single one-hour format session. Participants were educated on the recommended American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American Psychiatric Association (APA) Consensus Guidelines for Baseline Assessment and Monitoring Frequency of Persons on Atypical Antipsychotic Agents as the recommended process for screening and monitoring metabolic syndrome. Eight weeks following the provider-focused intervention, the investigator will perform a post-education 18-item questionnaire and a retrospective chart review. Data collected as part of the pre-intervention baseline survey and chart review will be compared to the post-survey and post- retrospective chart review data to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention on attitude, knowledge and monitoring trends of providers. Results: Outcomes for this project are unavailable since the project is currently in the implementation phase. Dissemination of results will be available post data analysis in December 2015. Trends and evidence of practice change will be measured and reported based on the results of the repeated measures and analysis of variance. Conclusions/Implications: Metabolic screening and monitoring practices lead to enhanced health management practices and includes improved medication therapy management, increased health and wellness education and increased medical referrals. This scholarly project emphasizes the relevance of following guidelines for the care of antipsychotic-treated individuals. It further challenges psychiatric providers to reconsider their current practice and follow the metabolic syndrome monitoring protocol as the most current best practice clinical guideline. Finally this scholarly work further validates the need for translation of evidence-based research, in this area of expertise, for positive outcomes in patients seeking psychiatric treatment. Potential benefits of routine antipsychotic-induced metabolic screening and monitoring include a decrease in metabolic health complications and premature death in mental health patients.The results of this project may be useful in guiding future advanced practice nursing educational interventions to enhance provider's attitude, knowledge and monitoring behaviors of metabolic abnormalities. Future research should focus on the development and implementation of cost effective screening and monitoring strategies in clinical settings as part of routine care, to guide future educational interventions.

AB  - A substantial proportion of the individuals with mild hypertension and the majority of individuals with moderate or severe hypertension need two or more antihypertensive medications to achieve adequate blood pressure control. The rationale for combining antihypertensive medications with different pharmacologic actions is to potentiate the hypotensive effects while minimizing dose-dependent side effects. Antihypertensive drugs can be selected that reduce blood pressure and have beneficial effects in concomitant illness and neutral or positive effects on cardiovascular risk factors. Drug therapy planning should be individualized to accommodate specific patient considerations including the potential impact of drug therapy on quality of life. In this article, beneficial as well as adverse effects of antihypertensive drug combinations are reviewed to determine special advantages or concerns in the treatment of essential hypertension.

AB  - Objective: Describe a novel approach to comprehensively summarize medication adherence.Data Sources/study Setting: Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry (n approximately 220,000)Study Design: In a new prescription cohort design (27,329 subjects prescribed new medications), we used pharmacy utilization data to estimate adherence during 24 months follow-up. Proportion of time without sufficient medications (medication gaps) was estimated using a novel measure (New Prescription Medication Gaps [NPMG]) and compared with a traditional measure of adherence.Data Collection/extraction Methods: Data derived from electronic medical records and survey responses.Principal Findings: Twenty-two percent of patients did not become ongoing users (had zero or only one dispensing of the new prescription). The proportion of newly prescribed patients that never became ongoing users was eightfold greater than the proportion who maintained ongoing use, but with inadequate adherence. Four percent of those with at least two dispensings discontinued therapy during the 24 months follow-up. NPMG was significantly associated with high out-of-pocket costs, self-reported adherence, and clinical response to therapy.Conclusions: NPMG is a valid adherence measure. Findings also suggest a larger burden of inadequate adherence than previously thought. Public health efforts have traditionally focused on improving adherence in ongoing users; clearly more attention is needed to address nonpersistence in the very first stages after a new medication is prescribed.

AU  - Verme-Gibboney C
T2  - American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy
AB  - The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical uses, adverse effects, drug interactions, dosage, cost, and therapeutic interchange of oral angiotension-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are reviewed. ACE inhibitors attenuate the formation of angiotension II and may lead to the accumulation of kinins. Although the hypotensive effects of many ACE inhibitors may persist for 24 hours, some patients require more than one dose per day to achieve adequate control. These agents accumulate in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, but it is unclear whether dosage adjustments are necessary. ACE inhibitors are effective against mild to moderate hypertension; for severe hypertension, additional anti-hypertensive agents may be necessary. Other conditions in which ACE inhibitors have shown efficacy include congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, left ventricular dysfunction, left ventricular hypertrophy, chronic renal insufficiency, insulin sensitivity, and coronary artery disease. The most common adverse effect is a persistent nonproductive cough. Angioedema, fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, acute renal failure, and hyperkalemia may also occur. ACE inhibitors may interact with diuretics, lithium, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral hypoglycemic agents, and some other drugs. ACE inhibitor therapy should be initiated with low doses that may then be slowly adjusted upward. Many of the agents have similar costs for lower and higher dosages. The only significant differences among the ACE inhibitors are the time of onset of hypotensive effects, time to peak effect, and duration of effect. Each formulary should include, at least, captopril and one intermediate-acting and one long-acting ACE inhibitor.

AB  - Background: Nonadherence to medications by patients requiring hemodialysis (HD) leads to unfavorable clinical outcomes. Limited data exist to demonstrate the effect of incorporating patient-centered interventions using concepts of medication therapy management and motivational interview by pharmacists on pharmacoadherence in patients requiring HD. Therefore, we assessed the impact of patient-centered pharmacist care on pharmacoadherence and its outcomes in patients requiring HD.Methods: Adult patients who had received outpatient HD for at least 3 months were enrolled. The study was conducted from October 2016 to April 2017. Pharmacists interviewed the patients at month 1, 2, 4 and 6, and the intervention (comprehensive review) occurred at months 3 and 5. The primary outcome was the change in pharmacoadherence as assessed by pre-HD serum phosphate levels and the differences in the number of medications between patient' self-report and medications records at the electronic healthcare records (EHRs). The secondary outcomes included changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), glycosylated hemoglobin levels, serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and the prevalence and types of medication-related problems (MRPs).Results: Seventy-two patients were enrolled. Their median age was 59 (interquartile range: 47-67.5) years, and 53% were men. Pre- and post-intervention pharmacoadherence, as indicated by serum phosphate levels and the differences in the number of medications between patient' self-report and the medication records at the EHRs, did not significantly differ (p = 0.682 and 0.348, respectively). Mean SBP and mean LDL did not significantly change post-intervention. The median number of MRPs declined between Months 3 and 5 (p = 0.002): the prevalence of MRPs at Month 3 was 44.9% (95 confidence interval [CI]: 40.4-49.3) and decreased to 29.8% (95 CI: 25.6-34.3) at Month 5. Drug use without indication was the most frequent MRP (23.9%).Conclusions: Patient-centered pharmacist care did not result in significant changes in pharmacoadherence. However, its clinical utility as a tool to identify and mitigate MRPs in patients requiring HD is indisputable.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03576404 (retrospectively registered on July 3rd, 2018).

AB  - Context: Although clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy, little is known about how these drugs are prescribed or used in the general population.Objective: To estimate predictors of persistence with therapy for lipid-lowering drug regimens in typical populations of patients in the United States and Canada.Design: A cohort study defining all prescriptions filled for lipid-lowering drugs during 1 year, as well as patients' demographic and clinical characteristics.Setting: New Jersey's Medicaid and Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled programs and Quebec's provincial medical care program.Patients: All continuously enrolled patients older than 65 years who filled 1 or more prescriptions for lipid-lowering drugs (N = 5611 in the US programs, and N = 1676 drawn from a 10% sample in Quebec).Main Outcome Measures: Proportion of days during the study year for which patients had filled prescriptions for lipid-lowering drugs; predictors of good vs poor persistence with therapy.Results: In both populations, patients failed to fill prescriptions for lipid-lowering drugs for about 40% of the study year. Persistence rates with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors were significantly higher than those seen with cholestyramine (64.3% vs 36.6% of days with drug available, respectively). Patients with hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease had significantly higher rates of persistence with lipid-lowering regimens. In New Jersey, multivariable analysis indicated that the poorest patients (those enrolled in Medicaid) had lower rates of drug use than less indigent patients (those enrolled in Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and Disabled) after adjusting for possible confounders, despite virtually complete drug coverage in both programs. When rates of use were measured in the US population for the 5 years following the study year, only 52% of surviving patients who were initially prescribed lipid-lowering drugs were still filling prescriptions for this drug class.Conclusion: In all populations studied, patients who were prescribed lipid-lowering drug regimens remained without filled prescriptions for over a third of the study year on average. Rates of persistence varied substantially with choice of agent prescribed, comorbidity, and socioeconomic status, despite universal coverage of prescription drug costs. After 5 years, about half of the surviving original cohort in the United States had stopped using lipid-lowering therapy altogether.

AB  - The objective of this prospective, pre-post longitudinal study was to assess the impact of pharmacist-provided medication therapy management (MTM) services on employees' health and well-being by evaluating their clinical and humanistic outcomes. City of Toledo employees and/or their spouses and dependents with diabetes with or without comorbid conditions were enrolled in the pharmacist-conducted MTM program. Participants scheduled consultations with the pharmacist at predetermined intervals. Overall health outcomes, such as clinical markers, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), disease knowledge, and social and process measures, were documented at these visits and assessed for improvement. Changes in patient outcomes over time were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank and Friedman test at an a priori level of 0.05. Spearman correlation was used to measure the relationship between clinical and humanistic outcomes. A total of 101 patients enrolled in the program. At the end of 1 year, patients' A1c levels decreased on average by 0.27 from their baseline values. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure also decreased on average by 6.0 and 4.2 mmHg, respectively. Patient knowledge of disease conditions and certain aspects or components of HRQoL also improved. Improvements in social and process measures also were also observed. Improved clinical outcomes and quality of life can affect employee productivity and help reduce costs for employers by reducing disease-related missed days of work. Employers seeking to save costs and impact productivity can utilize the services provided by pharmacists. ( Population Health Management 2014;17:21-27)

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Several trials demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events during long-term follow-up in high-risk and low-risk patients. Clinical treatment guidelines propose that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be considered in the routine secondary prevention in the broad group of coronary artery disease patients. This review discusses several approaches to guide angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibition therapy to more specific groups of patients that are most likely to benefit. RECENT FINDINGS: The beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition has been shown to be consistent across subgroups in stable coronary artery disease. Still, large interindividual variability in blood pressure response is well documented. It should also be realized that the absolute treatment effects are modest. The efficiency and cost-effectiveness of this prolonged prophylactic treatment would be significantly enhanced if those patients can be distinguished who benefit most. Recently, it was suggested that markers of an activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might be used to guide angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibition therapy. SUMMARY: At the start of treatment, clinical characteristics are not sufficient to distinguish between patients who will and will not benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Although pharmacogenetic research in coronary artery disease is still in a premature stage, it may be expected to provide a useful tool in optimizing and individualizing the management of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor therapy in coronary artery disease patients.

AU  - Campbell ML

T2  - American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy
AB  - Past and current drug therapies for weight loss are discussed. More than 50% of Americans can be categorized as overweight or obese. Obesity is associated with increased mortality and with comorbidities such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and certain cancers. According to guidelines for identification, evaluation, and treatment of obesity, patients with a body mass index (BMI) of > or = 30 kg/m2 should attempt to lose weight. Patients with a BMI of > or = 25 kg/m2 plus two or more risk factors or patients with an excessive waist circumference plus two or more risk factors should also attempt to lose weight. The initial goal is a 10% weight reduction in six months achieved through lifestyle changes. If lifestyle changes alone are not effective, then drug therapy may be indicated. Pharmacotherapeutic options for obesity have decreased over the past few years. Fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, and phenylpropanolamine have been withdrawn because of severe adverse effects, leaving only sympathomimetics, sibutramine, and orlistat as anorectics with FDA-approved labeling. Phentermine has been shown to cause a 5-15% weight loss if given daily or intermittently. Compared with sibutramine and orlistat, phentermine is cheaper, and specific formulations allow once-daily administration. However, phentermine is indicated only for short-term treatment, and tolerance often develops. Common adverse effects associated with phentermine are dry mouth, insomnia, increased blood pressure, and constipation. Sibutramine increases norepinephrine and serotonin levels in the CNS and should not be taken with many antidepressants because of the risk of increased norepinephrine and serotonin levels. Its use is also contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease. Orlistat is not systemically absorbed; therefore, it does not cause the systemic adverse effects or drug interactions of phentermine and sibutramine. Orlistat has a cholesterol-lowering effect not seen with other diet medications. However, the three-times-daily administration and frequent gastrointestinal effects limit its use. Sibutramine, phentermine, and orlistat have both positive and negative properties. Choosing among the medications will depend on concurrent disease states and medications, ease of administration, and cost.

T2  - Journal for Nurse Practitioners
AB  - Polypharmacy is a common observation among older adults secondary to their complex medical needs requiring management with 1 or more medications. The use of numerous medications may result in medication-related problems such as inappropriate indications, therapeutic duplication, adverse effects, drug interactions, unnecessary medications, poor adherence, and a strain on health care resources. Nurse practitioners will be required to review and streamline the appropriate and safe use of medications in patients to minimize some of the highlighted concerns. This article uses a case-based approach to showcase various issues that a nurse practitioner may encounter as it relates to polypharmacy and pharmacotherapeutic considerations. Tools are also explored to assess polypharmacy in the field. • Polypharmacy is a prevalent concern among adults who may be taking a combination of medications. • This may result in various medication-related problems such as adverse effects, drug interactions, inappropriate therapy, or nonadherence. • It is important for health practitioners to be cognizant of the tools and methods to manage polypharmacy-related issues to optimize patient outcomes.

AB  - Purpose: A collaborative pharmacist-primary care provider (PharmD-PCP) team approach to medicationtherapy management (MTM), with pharmacists initiating and changing medications at separate office visits, holds promise for the cost-effective management of hypertension, but has not been evaluated in many systematic trials. The primary objective of this study was to examine blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive patients managed by a newly formed PharmD-PCP MTM team versus usual care in a university-based primary care clinic. Methods: This randomized, pragmatic clinical trial was conducted in hypertensive patients randomly selected for PharmD-PCP MTM or usual care. In the PharmD-PCP MTM group, pharmacists managed drug-therapy initiation and monitoring, medication adjustments, biometric assessments, laboratory tests, and patient education. In the usual-care group, patients continued to see their PCPs. Participants were aged >/=18 years, were diagnosed with hypertension, had a most recent BP measurement of >/=140/ >/=90 mm Hg (>/=130/ >/=80 mm Hg if codiagnosed with diabetes mellitus), were on at least 1 antihypertensive medication, and were English speaking. The primary outcome was the difference in the mean change from baseline in systolic BP at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the percentage achieving therapeutic BP goal and the mean changes from baseline in diastolic BP and lowand high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Findings: A total of 166 patients were enrolled (69 men; mean age, 67.7 years; PharmD-PCP MTM group, n = 75; usual-care group, n = 91). Mean reduction in SBP was significantly greater in the PharmD-PCP MTM group at 6 months (-7.1 [19.4] vs +1.6 [21.0] mm Hg; P = 0.008), but the difference was no longer statistically significant at 9 months (-5.2 [16.9] vs -1.7 [17.7] mm Hg; P = 0.22), based on an intent-to-treat analysis. In the intervention group, greater percentages of patients who continued to see the MTM pharmacist versus those who returned to their PCP were at goal at 6 months (81% vs 44%) and at 9 months (70% vs 52%). No significant betweengroup differences in changes in cholesterol were detected at 6 and 9 months; however, the mean baseline values were near recommended levels. The PharmD-PCP MTM group had significantly fewer PCP visits compared with the usual-care group (1.8 [1.5] vs 4.2 [1.0]; P o 0.001). Implications: A PharmD-PCP collaborative MTM service was more effective in lowering BP than was usual care at 6 months in all patients and at 9 months in patients who continued to see the pharmacist. Incorporating pharmacists into the primary care team may be a successful strategy for managing medication therapy, improving patient outcomes and possibly extending the capacity of primary care.

AB  - Objective: Assess clinical and economic outcomes of a community-based, long-term medication therapy management (MTM) program for hypertension (HTN)/dyslipidemia. Design: Quasi-experimental, longitudinal, pre-post study. Setting: 12 community and hospital pharmacy clinics in Asheville, N.C., over a 6-year period from 2000 through 2005. Participants: Patients covered by two self-insured health plans; educators at Mission Hospitals; 18 certificate-trained pharmacists. interventions: Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular (collectively abbreviated as CV) risk reduction education; regular, long-term follow-up by pharmacists (reimbursed by health plans) using scheduled consultations, monitoring, and recommendations to physicians. Main outcome measures: Clinical and economic parameters. Results: Sufficient data were available for 620 patients in the financial cohort and 565 patients in clinical cohort. Several indicators of cardiovascular health improved over the course of the study: mean systolic blood pressure, from 137.3 to 126.3 mm Hg; mean diastolic blood pressure, from 82.6 to 77.8 mm Hg; percentage of patients at blood pressure goal, from 40.2% to 67.4%; mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, from 127.2 to 108.3 mg/dL; percentage of patients at LDL cholesterol goal, from 49.9% to 74.6%; mean total cholesterol, from 211.4 to 184.3 mg/dL; and mean serum triglycerides, from 192.8 to 154.4 mg/dL. Mean high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol decreased from 48 to 46.6 mg/dL. The CV event rate during the historical period, 77 per 1,000 person-years, declined by almost one-half (38 per 1,000 person-years) during the study period. Mean cost per CV event in the study period was $9,931, compared with $14,343 during the historical period. During the study period, CV medication use increased nearly threefold, but CV-related medical costs decreased by 46.5%. CV-related medical costs decreased from 30.6% of total health care costs to 19%. A 53% decrease in risk of a CV event and greater than 50% decrease in risk of a CV-related emergency department (ED)/hospital visit were also observed. Conclusion: Patients with HTN and/or dyslipidemia receiving education and long-term MTM services achieved significant clinical improvements that were sustained for as long as 6 years, a significant increase in the use of CV medications, and a decrease in CV events and related medical costs.

AB  - Background: The pharmacist's role shifts from dispensing to bedside care, resulting in better patient health outcomes. Pharmacists in developed countries ensure rational drug use, improve clinical outcomes, and promote health status by working as part of a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals. However, clinical pharmacist services on healthcare utilization in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) like Pakistan are unclear. As a result, we aim to systematically review pharmacists' clinical roles in improving Pakistani patients' therapeutic, safety, humanistic, and economic outcomes.Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library for relevant articles published from inception to 28th February 2021. All authors were involved in the screening and selection of studies. Original studies investigating the therapeutic, humanistic, safety, and economic impact of clinical pharmacists in Pakistani patients (hospitalised or outpatients) were selected. Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias in studies, and discrepancies were resolved through mutual consensus. All of the included studies were descriptively synthesised, and PRISMA reporting guidelines were followed.Results: The literature search found 751 articles from which nine studies were included; seven were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and two were observational studies. Three RCTs included were having a low risk of bias (ROB), two RCTs were having an unclear ROB, while two RCTs were having a high ROB. The nature of clinical pharmacist interventions included one or more components such as disease-related education, lifestyle changes, medication adherence counselling, medication therapy management, and discussions with physicians about prescription modification if necessary. Clinical pharmacist interventions reduce medication-related errors, improve therapeutic outcomes such as blood pressure, glycemic control, lipid control, CD4 T lymphocytes, and renal functions, and improve humanistic outcomes such as patient knowledge, adherence, and health-related quality of life. However, no study reported the economic outcomes of interventions.Conclusions: The findings of the studies included in this systematic review suggest that clinical pharmacists play important roles in improving patients' health outcomes in Pakistan; however, it should be noted that the majority of the studies have a high risk of bias, and more research with appropriate study designs is needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine how often treatment for hyperlipidemia followed the use of thiazides, compared with the use of other antihypertensive drugs, in older patients. DESIGN: Retrospective follow-up of all health claims filed over a 12-month period. SETTING: New Jersey Medicaid and Medicare programs. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 9274 enrollees, aged 65 to 99, who were newly initiated on antihypertensive medications from 1981-1989. MEASUREMENTS: We measured rates of lipid-reducing agent (LRA) initiation among patients in the 2 years following antihypertensive initiation (thiazide, non-thiazide drug, or combinations of the two) compared with rates among patients not currently taking antihypertensive agents. We used Cox regression analyses to estimate relative risks (RR), accounting for switching in antihypertensive therapy and for time when drug therapy was not currently available according to pharmacy refill records. RESULTS: There were 226 patients (2.4%) in the cohort who were started on LRA during the follow-up period. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found no significant relationship between LRA initiation and overall thiazide use (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.89-2.40), or other antihypertensive use, relative to no current exposure. However, use of high-dose thiazides (> or = 50 mg) was associated significantly with LRA initiation (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.12-3.45). Factors associated with decreased incidence of LRA use included age > or = 85 (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36-0.96), black race (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91), and nursing home residency (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.11-0.35). CONCLUSION: Use of low-cost and effective thiazide diuretics in older hypertensives was not associated with more common initiation of lipid-reducing agents, except with high-dose use of thiazides currently seen as inappropriate in most cases. Age and race were important determinants of LRA use.

AB  - Introduction: In the United States, college-aged people have the highest rates of unintended pregnancy (59%). In 2021, 10-15% of college students reported having vaginal sex without contraception. As of December 2021, 20 states/jurisdictions allowed pharmacists to prescribe contraceptives without a collaborative practice agreement/drug therapy management (CPA/CDTM) protocol. Indiana does not currently have permissive legislation. Research Question or Hypothesis: The implementation of a pharmacist contraceptive prescribing service in a campus community pharmacy in Indiana will have a high degree of uptake. Study Design: Retrospective, chart review (August 1, 2020 - May 30, 2022). Methods: Utilizing a CDTM with the campus student health service, Purdue University Pharmacy created a pharmacist contraception prescribing service for students. The service follows established contraception prescribing protocols and charges a consultation fee. Data was retrospectively collected for consultations (age, blood pressure, United States' Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use category 3/4 conditions, interacting medications, method prescribed [pills, patches, rings, injections, gels, emergency contraception], time to complete appointment). Descriptive statistical analyses were completed via Excel. Results: 364 consultations occurred, resulting in 351 (96.4%) prescriptions. Of these, 265 (75.5%) were for combined oral pills, 17 (4.8%) were for progestin only pills, 15 (4.3%) were for patches, 11 (3.1%) were for rings, 42 (12%) were for injections, and 1 (0.3%) was for a gel. The number of encounters increased from 126 (year 1) to 238 (year 2). The average age of participants was 21 years (range: 18-35), and appointments took an average of 21 minutes (range: 10-65). Nine (2.5%) people had a category 3/4 condition and 8 (2.2%) participants were on an interacting medication. The encounters resulted in $9,100 of revenue. Conclusion: The prescribing service at the Purdue University Pharmacy is a unique approach to expand access to contraception for young people. Few external resources are required to implement this service, and most patients were eligible to receive hormonal contraception.

AB  - About one in ten Americans has type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Poorly managed diabetes causes serious complications that diminish quality of life and life expectancy, with substantial cost to the healthcare system and patients. Pharmacists are well-equipped to provide medication therapy management (MTM) services for managing diabetes, but cost-effectiveness of MTM is not known. Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of MTMC, versus no MTMC, for treating patients with T2DM. Methods: Clinical data for 78 individuals with T2DM treated at University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences System’s MTMC during 2001-2012 were collected from electronic medical records. A control group with the same characteristics was simulated. Adjusted difference-in-difference estimates of -0.63 for HbA1c and -8.21 for systolic blood pressure, both favoring MTMC (versus no MTMC), were obtained from a previously published study on one-year impact of MTMC in the same patient sample. UKPDS Outcomes Model was used to obtain annual T2DM complication rates over ten years for both groups. Costs and utilities for T2DM complications, obtained from published literature, were applied to those with each complication in each year. Primary outcomes, discounted at 3% annually, included total costs (TC) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate uncertainty. Results: All results reported are over ten years. Without considering MTM service costs, MTMC group incurred $203,583 TC and 4.7524 QALYs. No MTMC group incurred $204,807 TC and 4.7419 QALYs. At current reimbursement rates, to be cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $150,000 per QALY gained, patients can be provided 27 and 45 MTMC visits, respectively, to reach and maintain the observed HbA1c and SBP. For every 1000 patients treated, MTMC avoided 2.10 myocardial infarctions, 6.11 strokes and 2.11 amputations. Conclusions: Current reimbursement models may need to be revised to incentivize provision of MTM services to T2DM patients.

T2  - Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the subject of quality improvement principles and methods applied to pharmacy services and to describe a framework for current and future efforts in pharmacy services quality improvement and effective drug therapy management. BACKGROUND: The Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy produced the Catalog of Pharmacy Quality Indicators in 1997, followed by the Summary of National Pharmacy Quality Measures in February 1999. In April 2002, AMCP introduced Pharmacy's Framework for Drug Therapy Management in the 21st Century. The Framework documents include a self-assessment tool that details more than 250 specific “components” that describe tasks, behaviors, skills, functions, duties, and responsibilities that contribute to meeting customer expectations for effective drug therapy management. FINDINGS: There are many opportunities for quality improvement in clinical, service, and cost outcomes related to drug therapy management. These may include patient safety; incidence of medical errors; adverse drug events; patient adherence to therapy; attainment of target goals of blood pressure, glucose, and lipid levels; risk reduction for adverse cardiac events and osteoporotic-related fractures; patient satisfaction; risk of hospitalization or mortality; and cost of care. Health care practitioners can measure improvements in health care quality in several ways including (a) a better patient outcome at the same cost, (b) the same patient outcome at lower cost, (c) a better patient outcome at lower cost, or (d) a significantly better patient outcome at moderately higher cost. Measurement makes effective management possible. A framework of component factors (e.g., tasks) is necessary to facilitate changes in the key processes and critical factors that will help individual practitioners and health care systems meet customer expectations in regard to drug therapy, thus improving these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Quality improvement in health care services in the United States will be made in incremental changes that rely on a structure-process-outcome model. The structure is provided by evidence created from controlled randomized trials and other studies of care and system outcomes that are based on the scientific method. The process portion is created by the application of evidence in the form of clinical practice guidelines, clinical practice models, and self-assessment tools such as Pharmacy's Framework for Drug Therapy Management. Incremental changes in structure and process will result in the desirable outcome of meeting customer needs for more effective drug therapy and disease management.

AB  - Introduction: Little is known about patient populations within family medicine residency-training clinics that should be targeted for clinical pharmacy interventions. The objective of this study was to identify patient characteristics associated with receiving an intervention by a clinical pharmacist. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 4870 patients aged 40 to 89 years with at least one office visit at the University of Colorado AF Williams Family Medicine clinic from August 1, 2014 to July 31, 2015. Electronic health record data were used to examine associations between 23 previously identified patient-specific elements and receipt of a clinical pharmacist intervention. Presence of a clinical pharmacist consultation note in the patient's record in the past 12 months was evidence of an intervention. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios. Results: Four percent (n = 182) of patients received at least one clinical pharmacist intervention. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that ≥10 active medications, A1c ≥ 9%, hypertension, depression/anxiety/panic disorder, asthma, indication for anticoagulant therapy, hospitalization/emergency department visit in the last 30 days, age ≥ 65, and Medicaid/uninsured increased the likelihood of receiving a clinical pharmacist intervention, while non-English speaking significantly decreased the likelihood of receiving a clinical pharmacist intervention. Patients with 7 or more elements were seven times more likely to have a clinical pharmacist intervention than patients with 6 or fewer items (odds ratio = 7.0, 95% confidence interval = 5.2-9.5). Conclusions: Patients with more elements were more likely to have received a clinical pharmacist intervention. The accumulation of these elements could be used for targeted population-based clinical pharmacist activities in residency training clinics.

TI  - Demonstrating the value of an innovative transitionof-care pharmacy service with quality measures and a unique way of gauging significance of pharmacy interventions
AU  - Kristeller, J.

T2  - Journal of the American Pharmacists Association
AB  - Objective: The objective is to quantify and describe outcomes achieved through an innovative clinical pharmacy service that initiates collaboration between hospital and community pharmacists and physicians to improve medication use through care transitions. Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs) are completed during hospitalization and medication-related problems (MRPs) are identified and then addressed with physicians as needed. Acute and chronic care issues are communicated with hospital and community physicians respectively. A summary of the CMR and suggested follow-up interventions or opportunities for patient education is shared with the patient's community pharmacist to facilitate ongoing medication management. The goal of this service is to improve patient outcomes by promoting safe and effective medication use. Methods: This observational study evaluated outcomes achieved during a 20-day timeframe. Eligible patients were admitted to the hospital, had multiple chronic diseases, at least five chronic medications, and a planned discharge to home. Once a CMR was completed, the hospital pharmacist communicated with the patient's hospital or community physician and community pharmacist to resolve or prevent MRPs. Data was gathered on the number of CMRs completed and the number and type of MRPs identified. Additionally, the clinical significance of each pharmacist intervention was scored on two innovative scales-criticality as related to clinical evidence and medication safety, and relevance as related to priorities of the patient. An example of high criticality would be recommending therapy such as an ACE-inhibitor in a patient with diabetes and hypertension where evidence of improved outcomes is widely accepted, or intervening to prevent a major adverse drug reaction. An intervention that is highly relevant to the patient could include issues related to cost, convenience, or improving a patient-oriented outcome such as mortality. Results: Twenty-four CMRs were completed and all but one had at least one MRP. There was an average of 1.6 corrections to the admission medication reconciliation per patient, 4.5 suggestions for the community pharmacist per patient, and 2.2 suggestions for the primary care physician per patient. Cardiovascular drugs were the most frequent class involved in a MRP (37%) followed by endocrine (18%), antithrombotic (13%) and gastrointestinal (11%) drug classes. Eleven percent of pharmacist interventions were scored as having high criticality related to clinical evidence, and 18% had both high criticality and high relevance to the patient. An example of an intervention with high criticality and relevance was identifying and resolving a MRP where a patient admitted with shortness of breath due to atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular ratewas using albuterol five times daily despite no history of pulmonary disease. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the productivity of an innovative pharmacy service focused on improving medication use and safety during care transitions. The service generated data demonstrating the need for pharmacists to complete a CMR and collaborate with hospital and community healthcare providers to resolve or prevent MRPs during error prone transitions of care. Measuring criticality related to clinical evidence and relevance to the patient is a unique strategy to describe the value of this service that has the potential to add an important dimension of information that can be used to solicit stakeholder support for clinical pharmacy services.

AB  - Background and objectives CKD is characterized by remarkably high hospitalization and readmission rates. Our study aim was to test a medication therapy management intervention to reduce subsequent acute care utilization. Design, setting, participants, & measurements The CKD Medication Intervention Trial was a single-blind (investigators), randomized clinical trial conducted at Providence Health Care in Spokane, Washington. Patients with CKD stages 3–5 not treated by dialysis who were hospitalized for acute illness were recruited. The intervention was designed to improve posthospitalization care by medication therapy management. A pharmacist delivered the intervention as a single home visit within 7 days of discharge. The intervention included these fundamental elements: comprehensive medication review, medication action plan, and a personal medication list. The primary outcome was a composite of acute care utilization (hospital readmissions and emergency department and urgent care visits) for 90 days after hospitalization. Results Baseline characteristics of participants (n=141) included the following: age, 69±11 (mean±SD) years old women, 48% (67 of 141) diabetes, 56%(79 of 141) hypertension, 83% (117 of 141) eGFR, 41±14 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (serum creatinine–based Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio median, 43 mg/g (interquartile range, 8–528) creatinine. The most common primary diagnoses for hospitalization were the following: cardiovascular events, 36% (51 of 141); infections, 18% (26 of 141); and kidney diseases, 12% (17 of 141). The primary outcome occurred in 32 of 72 (44%) of the medication intervention group and 28 of 69 (41%) of those in usual care (log rank P=0.72). For only hospital readmission, the rate was 19 of 72 (26%) in the medication intervention group and 18 of 69 (26%) in the usual care group (log rank P=0.95). There was no between-group difference in achievement of guideline-based goals for use of renin-angiotensin system inhibition or for BP, hemoglobin, phosphorus, or parathyroid hormone. Conclusions Acute care utilization after hospitalization was not reduced by a pharmacist-led medication therapy management intervention at the transition from hospital to home.

AB  - Purpose: Pharmacist-led medication therapy disease management (MTDM) has shown improvement in clinical outcomes in patients with certain chronic diseases. However, only limited data demonstrating the impact on health care utilization and cost of care are available. This study seeks to evaluate the impact of a pharmacist-led MTDM program on clinical surrogate outcomes, care utilization, and cost of care among patients with diabetes mellitus. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by utilizing electronic health records and insurance claims data. Patients were identified between February 2011 and December 2014. Data were collected from Geisinger, a large integrated health care system located in Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey. A total of 5,500 patients with diabetes mellitus were identified; 2,750 were enrolled in MTDM and were 1-to-1 propensity score-matched to a comparison cohort not enrolled in a pharmacist-led MTDM program. Results: There were no differences between groups in composite HbA1c, blood pressure, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment at 12 months (12% vs 12%, P=0.53). HbA1c goal was reached more frequently among patients without MTDM compared to those at 12 months (57% vs 51%, P<0.0001). There were no significant differences between the two cohorts in the attainment of blood pressure or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals at 12 months. MTDM was associated with reduced all-cause hospitalization rate (–19.6%; P=0.02) as well as increased primary care physician visits (18.5%; P<0.001) and lower average per-member-per-month medical cost (–13%, P=0.027). Conclusion: Despite the lack of impact on the clinical surrogate outcomes, MTDM was associated with lower cost of care and fewer hospitalizations, possibly facilitated by increased monitoring (ie, higher primary care utilization).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pharmacist-led medication review is a collaborative service which aims to identify and resolve medication-related problems.
OBJECTIVE: To critically evaluate published systematic reviews relevant to pharmacist-led medication reviews in community settings.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) were searched from 1995 to December 2015. Systematic reviews of all study designs and outcomes were considered. Methodological quality was assessed using the 11-item Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool. Systematic reviews of moderate or high quality (AMSTAR ≥ 4) were included in the data synthesis. Data extraction and quality assessment was performed independently by two investigators.
RESULTS: Of the 35 relevant systematic reviews identified, 24 were of moderate and seven of high quality and were included in the data synthesis. The largest overall numbers of unique primary research studies with favorable outcomes were for diabetes control (78% of studies reporting the outcome), blood pressure control (74%), cholesterol (63%), medication adherence (56%) and medication management (47%). Significant reductions in medication and/or healthcare costs were reported in 35% of primary research studies. Meta-analysis was performed in 12 systematic reviews. Results from the meta-analyses suggested positive impacts on glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, cholesterol, and number and appropriateness of medications. Conflicting findings were reported in relation to hospitalization. No meta-analyses reported reduced mortality.
CONCLUSION: Moderate and high quality systematic reviews support the value of pharmacist-led medication review for a range of clinical outcomes. Further research including more rigorous cost analyses are required to determine the impact of pharmacist-led medication reviews on humanistic and economic outcomes. Future systematic reviews should consider the inclusion of both qualitative and quantitative studies to comprehensively evaluate medication review.

AB  - Background: The hospital readmission rate in the population with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high and strategies to reduce this risk are urgently needed. Methods: The CKD-Medication Intervention Trial (CKD-MIT; www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCTO1459770) is a single-blind (investigators), randomized, clinical trial conducted at Providence Health Care in Spokane, Washington. Study participants are hospitalized patients with CKD stages 3-5 (not treated with kidney replacement therapy) and acute illness. The study intervention is a pharmacist-led, home-based, medication management intervention delivered within 7 days after hospital discharge. The primary outcome is a composite of hospital readmissions and visits to emergency departments and urgent care centers for 90 days following hospital discharge. Secondary outcomes are achievements of guideline-based targets for CKD risk factors and complications. Results: Enrollment began in February 2012 and ended in May 2015. At baseline, the age of participants was 69 ± 11 years (mean ± SD), 50% (77 of 155) were women, 83% (117 of 141) had hypertension and 56% (79 of 141) had diabetes. At baseline, the estimated glomerular filtration rate was 41 ± 14 ml/min/1.73 m2 and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 43 mg/g (interquartile range 8-528 mg/g). The most frequent diagnosis category for the index hospital admission was cardiovascular diseases at 34% (53 of 155), but the most common single diagnosis for admission was community-acquired acute kidney injury at 10% (16 of 155). Conclusion: Participants in CKD-MIT are typical of acutely ill hospitalized patients with CKD. A medication management intervention after hospital discharge is under study to reduce post-hospitalization acute care utilization and to improve CKD management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to antihypertensive medications is suboptimal. Hospital pharmacist interventions including motivational interviewing (MI) might assist in improving adherence in patients with hypertension. For an intervention to be useful, it is important to have tools that can easily identify potential adherence problems.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate process outcomes and patient- and pharmacist-reported outcomes of a pharmacist adherence intervention for hypertensive patients treated in hospital outpatient clinics. Secondly, to determine the agreement between two different adherence metrics: an adherence questionnaire used in the intervention and a prescription-based measure.
METHODS: The development of the intervention was based on adherence and behavioral theories and evidence of effective interventions. This included a focused medication review, a patient interview, and follow-up telephone calls. Two tools were used to identify adherence problems: The Drug Adherence Work-up (DRAW) tool and an adherence questionnaire. Process data included drug-related problems (DRPs) with recommendations to the physicians, medication- and lifestyle problems identified at the patient interview, actions taken and time spent on the intervention.
RESULTS: In total, 91 DRPs in 8 categories generated recommendations to the physicians; 56 recommendations were generated at the medication review and 35 at the patient interview. At the interview, 421 problems were identified, of which 60% were medication-related and 40% lifestyle-related. In connection with the interview, 528 actions were taken within 8 different categories. MI was a central technique applicable for most problems and was employed in nearly all patients (94%). About half of the patients reported increased focus on lifestyle change, and 21-39% reported increased knowledge, confidence and skills in relation to their medication as well as better quality of life. The pharmacists found that the intervention elements were meaningful pharmacist tasks, and that the DRAW tool was easy to use and helped them focus on addressing reasons for non-adherence. The mean total time spent by the pharmacist per patient was 2 h 14 min (SD 40 min).
CONCLUSIONS: A pharmacist-led, multifaceted, tailored adherence intervention was feasible for identifying and addressing a wide range of potential adherence and lifestyle problems. Among the intervention procedures, MI was a central technique, applicable in most types of problems. The questionnaire showed relatively little value for identifying non-adherence. The intervention was well accepted both by the pharmacists and the patients, thereby increasing the likeliness of successful implementation in routine practice.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Adherence to cardioprotective medication regimens in the year after hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is poor. OBJECTIVE To test a multifaceted intervention to improve adherence to cardiac medications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this randomized clinical trial, 253 patients from 4 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers located in Denver (Colorado), Seattle (Washington); Durham (North Carolina), and Little Rock (Arkansas) admitted with ACS were randomized to the multifaceted intervention (INT) or usual care (UC) prior to discharge. INTERVENTIONS The INT lasted for 1 year following discharge and comprised (1) pharmacist-led medication reconciliation and tailoring; (2) patient education; (3) collaborative care between pharmacist and a patient's primary care clinician and/or cardiologist; and (4) 2 types of voice messaging (educational and medication refill reminder calls). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome of interestwas proportion of patients adherent to medication regimens based on a mean proportion of days covered (PDC) greater than 0.80 in the year after hospital discharge using pharmacy refill data for 4 cardioprotective medications (clopidogrel, β-blockers, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors [statins], and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers [ACEI/ARB]). Secondary outcomes included achievement of blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level targets. RESULTS Of 253 patients, 241 (95.3%) completed the study (122 in INT and 119 in UC). In the INT group, 89.3%of patients were adherent compared with 73.9%in the UC group (P = .003). Mean PDC was higher in the INT group (0.94 vs 0.87; P< .001). A greater proportion of intervention patients were adherent to clopidogrel (86.8%vs 70.7%; P = .03), statins (93.2%vs 71.3%; P < .001), and ACEI/ARB (93.1% vs 81.7%; P = .03) but not β-blockers (88.1%vs 84.8%; P = .59). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients who achieved BP and LDL-C level goals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A multifaceted intervention comprising pharmacist-led medication reconciliation and tailoring, patient education, collaborative care between pharmacist and patients' primary care clinician and/or cardiologist, and voice messaging increased adherence to medication regimens in the year after ACS hospital discharge without improving BP and LDL-C levels. Understanding the impact of such improvement in adherence on clinical outcomes is needed prior to broader dissemination of the program. Copyright © 2014 American Medical Association.

AB  - PURPOSE: Transitions of care may involve multiple medication changes that lead to uncertainty about medication regimens and potential errors. This project addressed medication related problems identified during telephone calls to patients discharged from three SNFs. METHODS: An interprofessional team, centered in an outpatient geriatric clinic, composed of a pharmacist, social worker, and physician collaborated with three SNFs to develop a protocol to improve continuity of care for returning clinic patients. Information from the recent hospitalization and SNF stay included: discharge medication lists/summaries and medication administration records. Within 3 business days of discharge, a pharmacist and pharmacy student contacted patients or family representatives via telephone to identify drug therapy problems, perform medication reconciliation, and update the electronic medical record (EMR). Referrals were made to the social worker if necessary. Therapeutic recommendations were documented in the EMR and communicated to the interprofessional team. RESULTS: The pharmacy team contacted 10 patients, of which 8 had > 10 medications. All 10 patients (100%) were found to have medication related problems, with the most frequent problems being unnecessary drug therapy (50%) and adherence issues (50%). The pharmacist identified 26 medication-related problems (mean 2.6 per patient), made 17 recommendations and provided 22 counseling points. Common co-morbidities included: hypertension (70%), osteoporosis (50%), and pain (30%). Only 1 patient required hospitalization within 30 days after the encounter which was due to an infectious process unrelated to the previous admission. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists have a crucial role as part of an interprofessional team to identify and reduce the number of medication related problems in geriatric patients during transitions of care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Providing specialized patient care to patients with no insurance can enable them to better manage their medications, experience optimal outcomes, and ensure more effective use of health care services. This study measured improvement in low-income diabetic patient outcomes through participating in a MTM program. METHODS: Patients comprised of residents participating in the CareNet program, in Lucas County, OH which provides coordinated health care for low-income residents. Patients received MTM services from their pharmacists on a quarterly basis. Patients were provided diabetic supplies, such as lancets and test strips, at no cost to encourage participation. The study used a prospective pre-post design following patients for a year. Clinical [HbA1c level, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)] humanistic (patient satisfaction, adherence, knowledge surveys and quality of life) and social (caffeine and alcohol consumption, smoking, exercise) outcomes were measured at staggered intervals. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were enrolled. Clinical measures. Mean HbA1c concentration decreased from baseline to the three-month follow-up. Patients who had an HbA1c level greater than 7% at baseline saw a decrease of 0.5% from baseline to three months. Mean SBP and DBP values decreased significantly from baseline. Patients with a baseline SBP > 140 mmHg experienced a significant change in BP at 3 months (-16 mmHg). Patients with a baseline DBP of greater than 90 mmHg experienced a significant decrease of 16.00 mmHg from baseline. Humanistic measures. Patient knowledge increased for all disease states and overall patient satisfaction increased significantly. Social measures. There was a decrease in caffeine and alcohol consumption, a significant decrease in smoking, and increase in exercise. Nine month results for all outcomes will be presented. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists can improve quality of care, access to care and positive outcomes for low-income patients in a relatively short amount of time.

T2  - Journal of the American Geriatrics Society
AB  - Purpose:To describe use of innovation and technology within an integrated healthcare delivery system for the MTMP. Description: The Kaiser Permanente Georgia (KPGA) MTMP identifies and invites patients that are likely to incur annual drug costs greater than or equal to $4000; are taking at least 5 chronic or maintenance medications covered by Medicare Part D; and have at least 2 of the 5 following chronic conditions: asthma, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Participation is voluntary. Participants are tracked in a robust electronic database- Permanente Online Interactive Network Tools (POINT). POINT data includes claims, hospitalization, pharmacy, laboratory, physical exam, last/next provider dates, hospitalization risk calculators, chronic kidney disease staging, cancer screening metrics, naïve status of certain medications, co-payment information and last verified smoking status. KP GA uses an electronic medical record (EMR), allowing the MTM clinical pharmacists broader involvement in overall care of the patient. The clinical pharmacists perform an initial assessment to validate the complete medication profile and evaluate/address: patient adherence, drug therapy duplication, potential drug interactions, lab monitoring, potential cost-effective alternatives and drug therapy appropriateness. Working in collaboration with the patient's primary care physician (PCP), the clinical pharmacists develop and implement individualized plans with the use of therapeutic protocols. Patients are reevaluated at least quarterly via telephone or free in-person office visit with the pharmacist. Therapeutic recommendations are documented in the EMR using a template to ensure that documentation is consistent among pharmacists. Currently, 330 out of 750 eligible members are enrolled in the KPGA MTMP.The number of covered Part D 30 day equivalent prescriptions PMPM (per member/per month) is 7.81 compared to the overall Medicare population which is 2.52. The drug cost PMPM of Part D covered medications is $592.60 compared to the overall Medicare population (inclusive of MTM members) at $52.81. These data are not surprising, as members selected for the program have more chronic conditions and require more medications. Because the program directly helps the PCP address chronic conditions, it adds value to overall quality of care.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this report is to characterize the patient population served by the Grace Lamsam Pharmacy Program and to describe program outcomes. Methods; A chart review was conducted for all patients (n=100) participating in the Grade Lamsam Pharmacy Program from January 1, 2007 to February 6, 2008. The primary outcome data collected were the medication related problems (unnecessary drug therapy, needs additional drug therapy, ineffective drug therapy, dosage too low, dosage too high, adverse drug reaction, noncompliance, and needs different drug product) identified by pharmacists, the number and type of pharmacist interventions made, estimated cost savings from perspective of the patient and clinical data (hemoglobin A1C, blood pressure measurements, and LDL-C) for patients with diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, respectively. Basic demographic data was collected, including: patient gender, age, education level, race/ethnicity, marital status, and income. Patients' smoking status, type and number of medical conditions, medications being used at baseline, and number of pharmacist visits per patient during the study review period were also recorded. Results: The majority of patients cared for were male, middle-aged, and African-American. The majority (90%) of patients had an income below 150% of the 2007 Federal poverty level. Patients were most commonly treated for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. During the period of review, 188 medication related problems were identified and documented with noncompliance being the most common medication related problem identified. Pharmacists completed 477 Pharmaceutical Manufacturer Assistance Program applications for 68 patients. These interventions represented a cost savings from the patients' perspective of approximately 243 USD per month during the review period. Blood pressure, A1C, and LDL-C readings improved in patients enrolled in the clinical pharmacy program at the free clinic and the community health center. Conclusion: A clinical pharmacy services model provides a role for the pharmacist in an interdisciplinary team (beyond the traditional dispensing role) to identify medication related problems in the drug therapy of patients who utilize safety-net provider health care services.

T2  - Journal of managed care pharmacy : JMCP
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the subject of quality improvement principles and methods applied to pharmacy services and to describe a framework for current and future efforts in pharmacy services quality improvement and effective drug therapy management. BACKGROUND: The Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy produced the Catalog of Pharmacy Quality Indicators in 1997, followed by the Summary of National Pharmacy Quality Measures in February 1999. In April 2002, AMCP introduced Pharmacy's Framework for Drug Therapy Management in the 21st Century. The Framework documents include a self-assessment tool that details more than 250 specific "components" that describe tasks, behaviors, skills, functions, duties, and responsibilities that contribute to meeting customer expectations for effective drug therapy management. FINDINGS: There are many opportunities for quality improvement in clinical, service, and cost outcomes related to drug therapy management. These may include patient safety; incidence of medical errors; adverse drug events; patient adherence to therapy; attainment of target goals of blood pressure, glucose, and lipid levels; risk reduction for adverse cardiac events and osteoporotic-related fractures; patient satisfaction; risk of hospitalization or mortality; and cost of care. Health care practitioners can measure improvements in health care quality in several ways including (a) a better patient outcome at the same cost, (b) the same patient outcome at lower cost, (c) a better patient outcome at lower cost, or (d) a significantly better patient outcome at moderately higher cost. Measurement makes effective management possible. A framework of component factors (e.g., tasks) is necessary to facilitate changes in the key processes and critical factors that will help individual practitioners and health care systems meet customer expectations in regard to drug therapy, thus improving these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Quality improvement in health care services in the United States will be made in incremental changes that rely on a structure-process-outcome model. The structure is provided by evidence created from controlled randomized trials and other studies of care and system outcomes that are based on the scientific method. The process portion is created by the application of evidence in the form of clinical practice guidelines, clinical practice models, and self-assessment tools such as Pharmacy's Framework for Drug Therapy Management. Incremental changes in structure and process will result in the desirable outcome of meeting customer needs for more effective drug therapy and disease management.

T2  - Disease Management and Health Outcomes
AB  - Pharmacists are in an ideal position to assess, monitor and treat adherence-related problems that can adversely affect patients' health outcomes. To accomplish these goals, pharmacists must accept the responsibilities and challenges of a primary care provider. They also must assume an interdisciplinary role in collaborative drug therapy management. Strategies to monitor and improve adherence are key components of pharmaceutical care plans, especially for patients with chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic heart disease. This article gives an overview of guidelines, recommendations, current practices and related issues in the management of patients with diabetes mellitus. It also reviews the behavioral and social factors that influence adherence to therapeutic and lifestyle regimens, and highlights special needs in selected high-risk populations. Finally, best practice strategies that could serve as appropriate models for pharmaceutical care services are discussed. The overall goal is to enhance pharmacists' professional abilities to coordinate pharmaceutical care services targeted for major modifiable behavioral and biological risk factors. Pharmacists can overcome their apprehension about undertaking a primary care role in diabetes management through adequate preparation (including training and certification). The primary care functions that have been evaluated to date in the care of patients with diabetes mellitus by pharmacists show successful patient outcomes in terms of cost, quality of life and reduction of complications.
