AB  - Abstract
            
              Background
              Patients with hypertension continue to have less than optimal blood pressure control, with nearly one in five Canadian adults having hypertension. Pharmacist prescribing is gaining favor as a potential clinically efficacious and cost-effective means to improve both access and quality of care. With Alberta being the first province in Canada to have independent prescribing by pharmacists, it offers a unique opportunity to evaluate outcomes in patients who are prescribed antihypertensive therapy by pharmacists.
            
            
              Methods
              The study is a randomized controlled trial of enhanced pharmacist care, with the unit of randomization being the patient. Participants will be randomized to enhanced pharmacist care (patient identification, assessment, education, close follow-up, and prescribing/titration of antihypertensive medications) or usual care. Participants are patients in rural Alberta with undiagnosed/uncontrolled blood pressure, as defined by the Canadian Hypertension Education Program. The primary outcome is the change in systolic blood pressure between baseline and 24 weeks in the enhanced-care versus usual-care arms. There are also three substudies running in conjunction with the project examining different remuneration models, investigating patient knowledge, and assessing health-resource utilization amongst patients in each group.
            
            
              Discussion
              To date, one-third of the required sample size has been recruited. There are 15 communities and 17 pharmacists actively screening, recruiting, and following patients. This study will provide high-level evidence regarding pharmacist prescribing.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the effect of medication therapy management on chronic disease management and generic drug prescribing in the clinic setting. Methods: Private insurer initiates Pay-for-Performance (PFP) project for clinic-based pharmacists in Iowa and South Dakota (n = 9 clinics) in 2009. Each pharmacist was assigned âˆ½300 patients with at least 1 of 4 disease states (diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and asthma). Pharmacists were expected to complete 2 medication reviews for each patient. The primary outcome was frequency of patients achieving goal levels: diabetes: hemoglobin A1c (A1c) <8%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) <130 mg/dL, and blood pressure (BP) <140/80 mm Hg; hypertension: BP <140/90 mm Hg; hyperlipidemia: LDL <130 mg/dL; and asthma: percentage of persistent asthmatics on controller medication. Generic prescribing rates were evaluated for antihypertensives, cholesterol-lowering agents, proton pump inhibitors, and antidepressants. Results: A total of 827 patients at 3 clinics were included in the analysis. For diabetes, 77.1% had A1c <8%, 83.2% had LDL <130 mg/dL, and 76.3% had BP <140/80 mm Hg. For hypertension, 86.2% had BP <140/90 mm Hg. For hyperlipidemia, 80.6% had LDL <130 mg/dL. For asthma, 100% were on controller medication. One medication review was completed on 88.8% of patients. Generic prescribing rates ranged from 65.8% to 79.4%. Implications/Adaptability: A high percentage of patients achieved goal levels at clinics with clinical pharmacist services. A multidisciplinary approach to patient care may improve disease state management and medication cost savings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if a multimodal intervention composed of patient education, home blood pressure (BP) monitoring, BP measurement reporting to an interactive voice response (IVR) phone system, and clinical pharmacist follow-up improves BP control compared with usual care.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study with patient enrollment, medication consultation and adjustment, remote BP monitoring, and follow-up at 6 months.
METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted at 3 healthcare systems in Denver, Colorado, including a large health maintenance organization, a Veterans Affairs medical center, and a county hospital. At each site, patients with uncontrolled BP were randomized to the multimodal intervention vs usual care for 6 months, with the primary end point of BP reduction.
RESULTS: Of 338 patients randomized, 283 (84%) completed the study, including 138 intervention patients and 145 usual care patients. Baseline BP was higher in the intervention group vs the usual care group (150.5/89.4 vs 143.8/85.3 mm Hg). At 6 months, BPs were similar in the intervention group vs the usual care group (137.4 vs 136.7 mm Hg, P = .85 for systolic; 82.9 vs 81.1 mm Hg, P = .14 for diastolic). However, BP reductions were greater in the intervention group vs the usual care group (âˆ’13.1 vs âˆ’7.1 mm Hg, P = .006 for systolic; âˆ’6.5 vs âˆ’4.2 mm Hg, P = .07 for diastolic). Adherence to medications was similar between the 2 groups, but intervention patients had a greater increase in medication regimen intensity.
CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal intervention of patient education, home BP monitoring, BP measurement reporting to an IVR system, and clinical pharmacist follow-up achieved greater reductions in BP compared with usual care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a physician-led point of care medication delivery system (POCMDS) on adherence to glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol-lowering medications.
STUDY DESIGN: Prepost intervention observational study.
METHODS: From December 15, 2010, to December 14, 2012, we conducted a prepost analyses of 800 Medicare Advantage members receiving care in a network of capitated clinics in south Florida serving a predominantly minority population. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of diabetes for at least 1 year, taking at least 1 of the 3 classes of medications, and having received care in the clinic network for at least for 12 months before and after the POCMDS implementation. Our primary outcome is the medication possession ratio (proportion of days covered [PDC]) for each class of medication.
RESULTS: We found an absolute increase of 17 percentage points (95% CI, 13-20) in the PDC for oral antidiabetic agents, 29 (95% CI, 26-32) for cholesterol medications, and 21 (95% CI, 19-23) for blood pressure medications. Most of the subjects (80%) reported POCMDS was more convenient than using retail pharmacies. By having the POCMDS prioritize generic medications, the increases in adherence were not associated with increased pharmacy costs. At baseline, over half the patients were at goal for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, and systolic blood pressure; thus, we did not detect any additional improvements in these intermediate clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Among elderly minority patients with diabetes, a POCMDS improved adherence to various medications classes without increasing pharmacy costs. Thus, POCMDS may be of interest to policy makers, particularly in our current era of healthcare reform.
