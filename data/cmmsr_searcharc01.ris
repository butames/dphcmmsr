AB  - BACKGROUND: Many hypertensive patients discontinue drug therapy despite the increased cardiovascular risk associated with inadequately controlled hypertension. However, most experiments do not address this premature discontinuation of therapy, making it difficult to project the appropriateness of antihypertensive drugs in real-world use. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to assess patients' persistence with antihypertensive drug therapy in a nonexperimental setting. METHODS: An administrative database kept by the Local Health Unit of Ravenna, Ravenna, Italy, listing patient baseline characteristics, drug prescriptions, and hospital admissions was used to perform a population-based, retrospective study. The study included all patients who met the following criteria from January I through December 31, 1997: new user of antihypertensive drugs; > or = 20 years of age; receiving a first prescription for a diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin II-receptor antagonist (AIIA), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. All prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs filled during the 12-month follow-up period were used to define patients as continuers, switchers, or discontinuers on the basis of their persistence with therapy. RESULTS: A total of 16,783 patients were included in the study analyses: 7,409 men (44.1%) and 9,374 women (55.9%), with an average age of 56.1 +/- 18.3 years (range, 20-105 years). Of this study population, 64.9% (n = 10,894) discontinued treatment over the course of follow-up, 26.9% (n = 4508) continued treatment with the initially prescribed medication (with 5.1% [n = 862] adding another medication for combination therapy), and 8.2% (n = 1381) switched medications. Patients initially prescribed AIIAs were more likely to continue treatment than those initiated on other types of antihypertensives (P < 0.001). Discontinuation was associated with younger age, lower prevalence of concurrent chronic pharmacotherapies, and lower prevalence of previous hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease (all P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Health care claims data are a powerful tool for measuring continuation of therapy, providing detailed, populationwide epidemiologic and economic information for analyzing antihypertensive drug treatment. Further studies are required to relate pharmacotherapy to outcomes.

AB  - Hypertension is one of the most important causes of mortality, affecting the health status of the patient. At the same time, hypertension causes a huge health and economic burden on the whole world. The incidence and prevalence of hypertension are rising even among young people in both urban as well as rural communities. Although various conventional therapeutic moieties are available for the management of hypertension, they have serious flaws such as hepatic metabolism, reduced dose frequency, poor aqueous solubility, reduced bioavailability, and increased adverse effects, making the drug therapy ineffective. Therefore, it is required to design a novel drug delivery system having the capability to solve the constraints associated with conventional treatment of hypertension. Nanotechnology is a new way of using and manipulating the matter at the molecular level, whose functional organization is measured in nanometers. The applications of nanotechnology in the field of medicine provide an alternative and novel direction for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and show excellent performance in the field of targeted drug therapy. Various nanotechnologies based drug delivery systems, such as solid lipid nanoparticles, nanosuspension, nanoemulsion, liposome, self-emulsifying systems, and polymeric nanoparticles, are available. Among them, nanoemulsion has provided a niche to supplement currently available therapeutic choices due to numerous benefits like stability, ease of preparation, enhanced drug absorption, reduced hepatic metabolism, increased dose frequency, enhanced bioavailability, and encapsulation of hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic drugs. This present review provides an in-depth idea about progression in treatment of hypertension, constraints for antihypertensive drug therapy, need of nanoemulsions to overcome these constraints, comparative analysis of nanoemulsions over other nanostructure drug delivery systems, pharmacodynamics studies of nanoemulsions for treatment of hypertension, recent patents for drug-loaded nanoemulsions meant for hypertension, and marketed formulations of nanoemulsions for hypertension.

AB  - Background: The impact of pharmacist-led transition of care services with collaborative drug therapy management has shown to improve patients' outcomes and decrease health costs. Compelling statistics show higher readmission rates for under-insured patients compared with insured patients at primary health care clinics. Methods: This is a single center, prospective, cohort study designed to examine team-based collaborative drug therapy management and its effect on therapeutic outcomes of under-insured patients with target chronic diseases managed in a primary health center. Targeted chronic diseases included dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, anticoagulation disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure. The primary outcome measures included percentage of time in therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) and percentage of patients at targeted goals of blood pressure, lipids, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes included reduced emergency department visits, number of patient encounters, hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge, and disease exacerbation rates. Results: Patients were at INR goal 58% of the time compared with 52% at baseline (P =.66). There was a 9% improvement in mean HbA1c in the intervention group when compared with baseline (9.6% vs 10.9%, P =.03). With pharmacist intervention, 73.8% of the patients had their blood pressure at goal compared with 50% at baseline (P =.14). A limited number of patients were readmitted for different reasons, including uncontrolled disease states. Conclusions: The pharmacist-physician collaborative drug therapy management led to improved blood pressure control, average HbA1c, and time in therapeutic INR range. A decrease in health care utilization was also identified.

TI  - Blood pressure management: individualized treatment based on absolute risk and the potential for benefit.
AU  - Alderman, Michael H.
AU  - Alderman, M H
T2  - Annals of Internal Medicine
AB  - Clinical practice often conflicts with epidemiologic evidence in the management of blood pressure. Antihypertensive therapy is generally prescribed if blood pressure exceeds some arbitrary level, thus committing many persons with minimal cardiovascular risk to long-term drug therapy. By contrast, below that level, regardless of cardiovascular risk, blood pressure reduction is rarely sought. Epidemiologic data, however, consistently show a continuous, positive, linear relationship of the height of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with the incidence of stroke and heart attack. No threshold level distinguishes those who will have a cardiovascular event from those who will not. In fact, most heart attacks and many strokes occur among persons with "normal" blood pressures. Observational experience suggests that benefit could be obtained from universal blood pressure reduction of even a few millimeters of mercury. This public health strategy can be augmented by identifying those individuals, at every level of blood pressure, whose risk for cardiovascular disease justifies the cost of pharmacologic intervention. Antihypertensive drug therapy will be most efficient and effective if directed at those who, by virtue of their constellation of risk factors or evidence of preclinical vascular disease, are likely to have a heart attack or stroke. The resulting redirection of clinical resources will spare many hypertensive persons whose absolute risk for a cardiovascular event is small, from life-long treatment. At the same time, other persons, currently classified as normotensive, will become candidates for blood pressure reduction because their cardiovascular risk is high.

AB  - Objectives: To (1) provide medication therapy management (MTM) services to patients, (2) measure the clinical effects associated with the provision of MTM services, (3) measure the percent of patients achieving Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) goals for hypertension and hyperlipidemia in the MTM services intervention group in relationship to a comparison group who did not receive MTM services, and (4) compare patients' total health expenditures for the year before and after receiving MTM services.Design: Prospective study.Setting: Six ambulatory clinics in Minnesota from August 1, 2001, to July 31, 2002.Patients: 285 intervention group patients with at least 1 of 12 medical conditions using prestudy health claims; 126 comparison group patients with hypertension and 126 patients with hyperlipidemia were selected among 9 clinics without MTM services for HEDIS analysis.Intervention: MTM services provided by pharmacists to BlueCross BlueShield health plan beneficiaries in collaboration with primary care providers.Main Outcome Measures: Drug therapy problems resolved; percentage of patients' goals of therapy achieved and meeting HEDIS measures for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Total health expenditures per person were measured for a 1-year period before and after enrolling patients in MTM services.Results: 637 drug therapy problems were resolved among 285 intervention patients, and the percentage of patients' goals of therapy achieved increased from 76% to 90%. HEDIS measures improved in the intervention group compared with the comparison group for hypertension (71% versus 59%) and cholesterol management (52% versus 30%). Total health expenditures decreased from $11,965 to $8,197 per person (n = 186, P < 0.0001). The reduction in total annual health expenditures exceeded the cost of providing MTM services by more than 12 to 1.Conclusion: Patients receiving face-to-face MTM services provided by pharmacists in collaboration with prescribers experienced improved clinical outcomes and lower total health expenditures. Clinical outcomes of MTM services have chronic care improvement and value-based purchasing implications, and economic outcomes support inclusion of MTM services in health plan design.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effectiveness and cost savings of a real-world, continuous, pharmacist-delivered service with an employed patient population with diabetes over a 5-year period.Setting: The Patients, Pharmacists Partnerships (P3 Program) was offered as an "opt-in" benefit to employees of 6 public and private self-insured employers in Maryland and Virginia. Care was provided in ZIP code-matched locations and at 2 employers' worksites.Practice Description: Six hundred two enrolled patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes were studied between July 2006 and May 2012 with an average follow-up of 2.5 years per patient. Of these patients, 162 had health plan cost and utilization data. A network of 50 trained pharmacists provided chronic disease management to patients with diabetes using a common process of care. Communications were provided to patients and physicians.Practice Innovation: Employers provided incentives for patients who opted in, including waived medication copayments and free diabetes self-monitoring supplies. The service was provided at no cost to the patient. A Web-based, electronic medical record that complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act helped to standardize care. Quality assurance was conducted to ensure the standard of care.Evaluation: Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c), blood pressure, and total health care costs (before and after enrollment).Results: Statistically significant improvements were shown by mean decreases in A1c (-0.41%, P <0.001), low-density lipoprotein levels (-4.7 mg/dL, P = 0.003), systolic blood pressure (-2.3 mm Hg, P = 0.001), and diastolic blood pressure (-2.4 mm Hg, P <0.001). Total annual health care costs to employers declined by $1031 per beneficiary after the cost of the program was deducted. This 66-month real-world study confirms earlier findings. Employers netted savings through improved clinical outcomes and reduced emergency and hospital utilization when comparing costs 12 months before and after enrollment.Conclusion: The P3 program had positive clinical outcomes and economic outcomes. Pharmacist-provided comprehensive medication therapy management services should be included as a required element of insurance offered by employers and health insurance exchanges.

AB  - Objective: This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine as monotherapy and in combination therapy in patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite pharmacologic treatment.Methods: This observational, open, prospective, parallel, controlled, multicenter, comparative, postmarketing drug surveillance study included hypertensive outpatients (systolic blood pressure [SBP] >/= 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] >/= 90 mm Hg) whose hypertension was uncontrolled despite pharmacologic treatment. Randomly selected primary care physicians chose the patients and assigned them to the group (amlodipine monotherapy or amlodipine as part of a 2-drug antihypertensive regimen) they considered more appropriate. Each patient was to have >/= 3 visits during the 4-month follow-up period. The initial dosage of amlodipine was 5 mg once daily; this dosage could be increased to 10 mg once daily to achieve control of hypertension. Main outcome measures included optimum and suboptimum control of hypertension and incidence of adverse events.Results: A total of 2628 patients (1838 [69.9%], amlodipine monotherapy; 790 [30.1%], combination therapy) participated in this study. Of these patients, 2406 had DBP >/= 90 mm Hg at baseline. Only 29 patients had DBP > 90 mm Hg and SBP < 140 mm Hg. By the end of the study, 28.6% of the 2442 patients for whom data were available had achieved the optimum therapeutic goal (SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 90 mm Hg). A total of 156 patients (5.9%) experienced adverse events, 93.0% mild (edema, headache, flushing) and 7.0% serious. In 78.3% of cases the prescribing physician considered the adverse event to be related to treatment, but none of the 13 serious adverse events in 11 patients were considered to be related to amlodipine. No significant difference in the incidence of adverse events was found between the patients receiving monotherapy and those receiving combination therapy. A significantly higher percentage of nondiabetic patients than diabetic patients experienced optimum control (P < 0.05).Conclusions: Amlodipine appears to be a well-tolerated and effective antihypertensive drug for use in monotherapy or a combination regimen in patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite pharmacologic treatment. Because the maximum dose (10 mg once daily) was not required in most patients and because combination therapy was often not needed, amlodipine may be a low-cost option for the treatment of hypertension.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate treatment of mild hypertension using combinations of diet and low-dose pharmacologic therapies.Design: Multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.Setting: Three university-based tertiary care centers.Patients: Patients (697) 21 to 65 years of age with diastolic blood pressure between 90 and 100 mm Hg as well as weight between 110% and 160% of ideal weight.Intervention: Patients were stratified by clinical center and race and were randomly assigned to one of three diets (usual, low-sodium and high-potassium, weight loss) and one of three agents (placebo, chlorthalidone, and atenolol).Measurements: Changes in measures of sexual problems, distress, and well-being after 6 months of therapy were analyzed.Main Results: Low-dose chlorthalidone and atenolol produced few side effects, except in men. Erection-related problems worsened in 28% (95% CI, 15% to 41%) of men receiving chlorthalidone and usual diet compared with 3% (CI, 0% to 9%) of those receiving placebo and usual diet (P = 0.009) and 11% (CI, 2% to 20%) of those receiving atenolol and usual diet (P greater than 0.05). The weight loss diet ameliorated this effect. The low-sodium diet with placebo was associated with greater fatigue (34%; CI, 23% to 45%) than was either usual diet (18%; CI, 10% to 27%; P = 0.04) or weight reduction (15%; CI, 7% to 23%; P = 0.009). The low-sodium diet with chlorthalidone increased problems with sleep (32%; CI, 22% to 42%) compared with chlorthalidone and usual diet (16%; CI, 8% to 24%; P = 0.04). The weight loss diet benefited quality of life most, reducing total physical complaints (P less than 0.001) and increasing satisfaction with health (P less than 0.001). Total physical complaints decreased in 57% to 76% of patients depending on drug and diet group, and were markedly decreased by weight loss.Conclusion: In general, low-dose antihypertensive drug therapy (with chlorthalidone or atenolol) improves rather than impairs the quality of life; however, chlorthalidone with usual diet increases sexual problems in men.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of benefit design change (BDC) on medication adherence and persistence (including switch in therapy), drug costs, and total healthcare costs. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study was performed using administrative claims data from an integrated healthcare system between January 2001 and December 2002. METHODS: Continuously enrolled patients in 2001 and 2002 with allergic rhinitis, asthma, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or osteoarthritis belonged to employer groups with or without a pharmacy BDC as of January 1, 2002. Prescription status (same, switch, or discontinue), adherence among patients receiving therapy, and differences in drug costs and total healthcare costs for each disease state were measured between groups. Bivariate and multivariate statistics were used to test differences in outcomes between groups. RESULTS: Compared with the group without BDC, the proportion of patients who discontinued drug therapy was significantly greater in the BDC group among those with allergic rhinitis (67% vs 54%), asthma (66% vs 50%), osteoarthritis (61% vs 36%), and hypertension (39% vs 18%) (P < .05 for all). Medication compliance was not affected by BDC. The year-to-year pharmacy costs per patient in the BDC group decreased $305 for patients with osteoarthritis (P < .001) and $95 for patients with allergic rhinitis (P = .03). There was no significant effect on overall healthcare costs in any disease state during the year following the BDC. CONCLUSION: A pharmacy BDC may result in decreased pharmacy costs, with no effect on overall healthcare costs within 1 year for patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, hypertension, or osteoarthritis.

AB  - Background: Hypertension is one of the leading risk factors for ischemic heart diseases, and high rates of hypertension prevalence have either remained the same or increased in developing countries in recent years. Unfortunately, about 20% to 50% of patients with chronic diseases have been nonadherent to their drug therapy. SMS text messaging and pharmacy student-led consultations have the potential to help patients manage their blood pressure (BP).Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of SMS text messaging and consultation to manage the BP of Chinese patients with hypertension.Methods: We conducted a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial among patients with hypertension in Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, China, and recruited 384 patients from 8 community health care centers. Patients were randomized into an intervention group to receive SMS text messages and consultations or into a control group to receive usual care for 3 months. We sent SMS text messages at 3-day intervals and collected data at baseline (including demographics, clinical outcomes, medication complexity, side effects, patient behavior, knowledge about hypertension, BP, and medication adherence) and the 3-month follow-up (including BP, medication adherence, and knowledge about hypertension).Results: We assessed 445 patients with hypertension and excluded 61 patients who were not eligible or who had not filled out their questionnaires. The mean age of the patients was 68.5 (SD 7.9) years in the intervention group and 69.4 (SD 9.7) years in the control group, and the sample was primarily female (265/384, 69.0%). Patients in the intervention group showed significant improvements in systolic BP (SBP; mean 134.5 mm Hg, SD 15.5 mm Hg vs mean 140.7 mm Hg, SD 15.2 mm Hg; P=.001), medication adherence (mean 7.4, SD 1.2 vs mean 7.0, SD 1.3; P=.04), and knowledge about hypertension (mean 6.3, SD 0.9 vs mean 5.9, SD 1.2; P=.004) compared with those in the control group. In measures of diastolic BP (DBP), the two arms showed nonsignificant improvements (mean 78.2 mm Hg, SD 9.0 mm Hg vs mean 77.2 mm Hg, SD 10.3 mm Hg; P=.06). In total, 176 patients had controlled BP at the 3-month follow-up (98 patients in the intervention group vs 78 patients in the control group), but it was nonsignificant (P=.08).Conclusions: The use of SMS text messaging and consultation to manage SBP and improve medication adherence is effective, feasible, and acceptable among Chinese patients with hypertension, although a significant difference was not observed with regard to DBP. It is important to maximize the potential of SMS text messaging and consultation by increasing the feasibility and acceptance of mobile interventions and conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis on this method.Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR1900026862; http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=42717.

T2  - Scandinavian Journal of Primary Health Care
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between blood pressure and medication adherence using electronic pillboxes (MEMS). SETTING: Five general practices in Bristol, UK. SUBJECTS: A total of 239 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of hypertension and being prescribed at least one blood pressure-lowering medication. Participants were asked to use the electronic pillbox as their drug bottle for at least one month. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 'Timing adherence' (correct inter-dose intervals) as measured through MEMS and systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) office blood pressure. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) timing adherence was 88% (+/-17),>80% in 175 (73%), and less than 50% in 11 (5%) participants. Adherence was monitored for a mean of 33 (+/-6) days. Mean (+/-SD) SBP was 147.9+/-19.1 mmHg and DBP 82.3+/-10.1 mmHg. There was no evidence to suggest that timing adherence was associated with SBP or DBP (overall correlation coefficients -0.01 and -0.02 respectively). According to current guidelines, about one in four of all participants had controlled SBP (only 6% of diabetic patients). DBP was under control in 66% of the individuals. CONCLUSIONS: No relationship between adherence and blood pressure in patients with hypertension recruited from primary care was found. Average timing adherence measured by electronic monitors was high (88%) and blood pressure was controlled in a minority of patients. Our findings suggest that in terms of poor blood pressure control pharmacological non-response to or insufficient intensity of blood pressure-lowering medication might be more important than poor adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hypertension is a highly prevalent disease worldwide, constituting one of the main risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aims of this study were to evaluate the level of awareness and control of hypertension comparing sex, socioeconomic and educational level, BMI and drug therapy in over 40-year-old patients. The cost-effectiveness of the main pharmacologic classes of antihypertensives, as monotherapy and combination therapy, was also assessed. METHODS: In this randomized and cross-sectional populational study, a sample of 738 hypertensive adults with ages at least 40 years were evaluated. Of these, 345 (46.7%) were men and 393 (53.3%) were women. RESULTS: A total of 72.9% of the hypertensives knew about their disease. Women in the 40-49 and 50-59 age groups and obese individuals had a higher rate of awareness of their hypertensive status. The rates of awareness were similar in different social classes and educational levels, however, blood pressure control varied. beta-Blockers were the most effective drugs to control blood pressure with no differences being observed between monotherapy and combinations. Diuretics were the most cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the participants received monotherapy. The best percentage of control with monotherapy was obtained with beta-blockers but the diuretics treatment was the most cost-effective. The levels of awareness and control were high compared with developed countries, most evident in the higher social classes and higher education levels.

AB  - Background: Adherence to medication is a critical factor in the continued health and well-being of patients with hypertension. Patients' acceptance of medical advice and information may be influenced by their subjective beliefs about their health condition; therefore, it is essential that their beliefs be taken into account when giving health advice or medical treatment.Objective: To determine whether a relationship exists between illness attribution, perceived control, and adherence to antihypertensive medications.Methods: A prospective, cross-sectional survey of hypertensive patients was conducted at the University of Michigan Medical Centers, Hypertension Clinic, Ann Arbor, MI. One hundred two patients with a goal to reduce their blood pressure were included in the study. Written and follow-up telephone survey questions assessing patients' illness attributions, perceived control, and medication adherence were administered. Associations between these variables were analyzed using correlation analyses.Results: The majority of patients (67.7%) were adherent with their hypertensive medications. Patients indicated that modifiable variables were the most common attribution believed to cause hypertension; however, there was no significant relationship to medication adherence. A significant inverse relationship was found between perceived control over hypertension and medication adherence (p < 0.01).Conclusions: The findings suggest that patients' greater perception of control over trying to reduce blood pressure may result in decreased reliance on medications and subsequent nonadherence to drug therapy. Implications of these findings on pharmacy practice are discussed.

AB  - The authors investigated the efficacy of a lifestyle educational program, organized in small group meetings, in improving the outcome of a nonpharmacologic intervention. One hundred and eighty-eight hypertensive patients with stable blood pressure (BP) levels and drug therapy in the previous 6 months were randomly divided into educational care (EC) and usual care (UC) groups. They were followed at 3-month intervals up to 2 years. In addition to the visits in an outpatient clinic, patients in the EC program participated in small group meetings in order to improve their knowledge of the disease and reinforce their motivation for treatment. At baseline, EC and UC groups were similar for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) levels, and pharmacologic treatment. Patients in the EC group had significantly reduced total energy, total and saturated fats, and sodium intake. Physical activity was significantly increased in the EC group as well. At the end of the 1-year follow-up, BMI (P<.001), visceral fat (P<.001), and BP (P<.001) were significantly lower in the EC group compared with the UC group. Pharmacologic treatment during the study was similar for all classes of drugs apart from diuretics whose dose was higher in the UC group at the end of the study.

AB  - A substantial proportion of the individuals with mild hypertension and the majority of individuals with moderate or severe hypertension need two or more antihypertensive medications to achieve adequate blood pressure control. The rationale for combining antihypertensive medications with different pharmacologic actions is to potentiate the hypotensive effects while minimizing dose-dependent side effects. Antihypertensive drugs can be selected that reduce blood pressure and have beneficial effects in concomitant illness and neutral or positive effects on cardiovascular risk factors. Drug therapy planning should be individualized to accommodate specific patient considerations including the potential impact of drug therapy on quality of life. In this article, beneficial as well as adverse effects of antihypertensive drug combinations are reviewed to determine special advantages or concerns in the treatment of essential hypertension.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Several trials demonstrated that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events during long-term follow-up in high-risk and low-risk patients. Clinical treatment guidelines propose that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be considered in the routine secondary prevention in the broad group of coronary artery disease patients. This review discusses several approaches to guide angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibition therapy to more specific groups of patients that are most likely to benefit. RECENT FINDINGS: The beneficial effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition has been shown to be consistent across subgroups in stable coronary artery disease. Still, large interindividual variability in blood pressure response is well documented. It should also be realized that the absolute treatment effects are modest. The efficiency and cost-effectiveness of this prolonged prophylactic treatment would be significantly enhanced if those patients can be distinguished who benefit most. Recently, it was suggested that markers of an activated renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system might be used to guide angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibition therapy. SUMMARY: At the start of treatment, clinical characteristics are not sufficient to distinguish between patients who will and will not benefit from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Although pharmacogenetic research in coronary artery disease is still in a premature stage, it may be expected to provide a useful tool in optimizing and individualizing the management of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor therapy in coronary artery disease patients.

Obesity is associated with increased mortality and with comorbidities such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and certain cancers. According to guidelines for identification, evaluation, and treatment of obesity, patients with a body mass index (BMI) of > or = 30 kg/m2 should attempt to lose weight. Patients with a BMI of > or = 25 kg/m2 plus two or more risk factors or patients with an excessive waist circumference plus two or more risk factors should also attempt to lose weight. The initial goal is a 10% weight reduction in six months achieved through lifestyle changes. If lifestyle changes alone are not effective, then drug therapy may be indicated. Pharmacotherapeutic options for obesity have decreased over the past few years. Fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, and phenylpropanolamine have been withdrawn because of severe adverse effects, leaving only sympathomimetics, sibutramine, and orlistat as anorectics with FDA-approved labeling. Phentermine has been shown to cause a 5-15% weight loss if given daily or intermittently. Compared with sibutramine and orlistat, phentermine is cheaper, and specific formulations allow once-daily administration. However, phentermine is indicated only for short-term treatment, and tolerance often develops. Common adverse effects associated with phentermine are dry mouth, insomnia, increased blood pressure, and constipation. Sibutramine increases norepinephrine and serotonin levels in the CNS and should not be taken with many antidepressants because of the risk of increased norepinephrine and serotonin levels. Its use is also contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease. Orlistat is not systemically absorbed; therefore, it does not cause the systemic adverse effects or drug interactions of phentermine and sibutramine. Orlistat has a cholesterol-lowering effect not seen with other diet medications. However, the three-times-daily administration and frequent gastrointestinal effects limit its use. Sibutramine, phentermine, and orlistat have both positive and negative properties. Choosing among the medications will depend on concurrent disease states and medications, ease of administration, and cost.

AB  - Purpose: A collaborative pharmacist-primary care provider (PharmD-PCP) team approach to medicationtherapy management (MTM), with pharmacists initiating and changing medications at separate office visits, holds promise for the cost-effective management of hypertension, but has not been evaluated in many systematic trials. The primary objective of this study was to examine blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive patients managed by a newly formed PharmD-PCP MTM team versus usual care in a university-based primary care clinic. Methods: This randomized, pragmatic clinical trial was conducted in hypertensive patients randomly selected for PharmD-PCP MTM or usual care. In the PharmD-PCP MTM group, pharmacists managed drug-therapy initiation and monitoring, medication adjustments, biometric assessments, laboratory tests, and patient education. In the usual-care group, patients continued to see their PCPs. Participants were aged >/=18 years, were diagnosed with hypertension, had a most recent BP measurement of >/=140/ >/=90 mm Hg (>/=130/ >/=80 mm Hg if codiagnosed with diabetes mellitus), were on at least 1 antihypertensive medication, and were English speaking. The primary outcome was the difference in the mean change from baseline in systolic BP at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the percentage achieving therapeutic BP goal and the mean changes from baseline in diastolic BP and lowand high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Findings: A total of 166 patients were enrolled (69 men; mean age, 67.7 years; PharmD-PCP MTM group, n = 75; usual-care group, n = 91). Mean reduction in SBP was significantly greater in the PharmD-PCP MTM group at 6 months (-7.1 [19.4] vs +1.6 [21.0] mm Hg; P = 0.008), but the difference was no longer statistically significant at 9 months (-5.2 [16.9] vs -1.7 [17.7] mm Hg; P = 0.22), based on an intent-to-treat analysis. In the intervention group, greater percentages of patients who continued to see the MTM pharmacist versus those who returned to their PCP were at goal at 6 months (81% vs 44%) and at 9 months (70% vs 52%). No significant betweengroup differences in changes in cholesterol were detected at 6 and 9 months; however, the mean baseline values were near recommended levels. The PharmD-PCP MTM group had significantly fewer PCP visits compared with the usual-care group (1.8 [1.5] vs 4.2 [1.0]; P o 0.001). Implications: A PharmD-PCP collaborative MTM service was more effective in lowering BP than was usual care at 6 months in all patients and at 9 months in patients who continued to see the pharmacist. Incorporating pharmacists into the primary care team may be a successful strategy for managing medication therapy, improving patient outcomes and possibly extending the capacity of primary care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine how often treatment for hyperlipidemia followed the use of thiazides, compared with the use of other antihypertensive drugs, in older patients. DESIGN: Retrospective follow-up of all health claims filed over a 12-month period. SETTING: New Jersey Medicaid and Medicare programs. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 9274 enrollees, aged 65 to 99, who were newly initiated on antihypertensive medications from 1981-1989. MEASUREMENTS: We measured rates of lipid-reducing agent (LRA) initiation among patients in the 2 years following antihypertensive initiation (thiazide, non-thiazide drug, or combinations of the two) compared with rates among patients not currently taking antihypertensive agents. We used Cox regression analyses to estimate relative risks (RR), accounting for switching in antihypertensive therapy and for time when drug therapy was not currently available according to pharmacy refill records. RESULTS: There were 226 patients (2.4%) in the cohort who were started on LRA during the follow-up period. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found no significant relationship between LRA initiation and overall thiazide use (RR 1.47, 95% CI 0.89-2.40), or other antihypertensive use, relative to no current exposure. However, use of high-dose thiazides (> or = 50 mg) was associated significantly with LRA initiation (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.12-3.45). Factors associated with decreased incidence of LRA use included age > or = 85 (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36-0.96), black race (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91), and nursing home residency (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.11-0.35). CONCLUSION: Use of low-cost and effective thiazide diuretics in older hypertensives was not associated with more common initiation of lipid-reducing agents, except with high-dose use of thiazides currently seen as inappropriate in most cases. Age and race were important determinants of LRA use.

AB  - Blacks are two to three times as likely as whites to die of preventable heart disease and stroke. Declines in mortality from heart disease have not eliminated  racial disparities. Control and effective treatment of hypertension, a leading  cause of cardiovascular disease, among blacks is less than in whites and remains  a challenge. One of the driving forces behind this racial/ethnic disparity is  medication nonadherence whose cause is embedded in social determinants. Eight  practical approaches to addressing medication adherence with the potential to  attenuate disparities were identified and include: (1) patient engagement  strategies, (2) consumer-directed health care, (3) patient portals, (4) smart  apps and text messages, (5) digital pillboxes, (6) pharmacist-led engagement, (7)  cardiac rehabilitation, and (8) cognitive-based behavior. However, while data  suggest that these strategies may improve medication adherence, the effect on  ameliorating racial/ethnic disparities is not certain. This review describes the  relationship between disparities and medication adherence, which likely plays a  role in persistent disparities in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite a variety of efficient and cost-effective antihypertensive medication, hypertension remains a serious health and economic burden. High  consumption of cardiovascular drugs in the Slovak Republic does result neither in  better hypertension control nor in significant decrease in cardiovascular  mortality. At the same time, Slovakia has alarmingly low patients' adherence to  medication intake. Studies have shown the efficiency of short messaging service  (SMS) reminders to improve patients' adherence and health outcomes at low costs.  Since SMS is popular among Slovaks, this approach may be feasible also in  Slovakia. The primary objective is to assess if daily SMS reminders of  antihypertensive medication intake provided by pharmacists in addition to the  standard pharmaceutical care increase the proportion of adherent older  hypertensive ambulatory patients. METHODS: The SPPA trial is a pragmatic  randomized parallel group (1:1) trial in 300 older hypertensive patients carried  out in community pharmacies in Slovakia. Trial pharmacies will be selected from  all main regions of Slovakia. Trial intervention comprises daily personalized SMS  reminders of medication intake embedded into usual pharmaceutical practice. The  primary outcome is a combined adherence endpoint consisting of subjective  self-reported medication adherence via the eight-item Morisky Medication  Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) and objective pill count rate. Secondary outcomes  include: change in the MMAS-8; comparison of adherence rates using pill count;  change in systolic blood pressure; and patient satisfaction. Also, direct  treatment costs will be evaluated and a cost-effectiveness analysis will be  carried out. DISCUSSION: The SPPA trial engages community pharmacists and mobile  health (mHealth) technologies via evidence-based pharmaceutical care to  efficiently and cost-effectively addresses current main healthcare challenges:  high prevalence of hypertension; overconsumption of cardiovascular medicines; low  adherence to medication treatment; and resulting uncontrolled blood pressure. The  results may identify new possibilities and capacities in healthcare with low  additional costs and high value to patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION:  ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03105687 .

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Uncontrolled hypertension is a common cause of cardiovascular disease, which is the deadliest and costliest chronic disease in the United  States. Pharmacists are an accessible community healthcare resource and are  equipped with clinical skills to improve the management of hypertension through  medication therapy management (MTM). Nevertheless, current reimbursement models  do not incentivize pharmacists to provide clinical services. We aim to  investigate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist-led comprehensive MTM clinic  compared with no clinic for 10-year primary prevention of stroke and  cardiovascular disease events in patients with hypertension. METHODS: We built a  semi-Markov model to evaluate the clinical and economic consequences of an MTM  clinic compared with no MTM clinic, from the payer perspective. The model was  populated with data from a recently published controlled observational study  investigating the effectiveness of an MTM clinic. Methodology was guided using  recommendations from the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and  Medicine, including appropriate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared with no  MTM clinic, the MTM clinic was cost-effective with an incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio of $38 798 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.  The incremental net monetary benefit was $993 294 considering a  willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY. Health-benefit benchmarks at  $100 000 per QALY and $150 000 per QALY translate to a 95% and 170% increase from  current reimbursement rates for MTM services. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows  current reimbursement rates for pharmacist-led MTM services may undervalue the  benefit realized by US payers. New reimbursement models are needed to allow  pharmacists to offer cost-effective clinical services.

AB  - The emphasis that United States employers are placing on employee wellness continues to grow; however, most attention has been paid to larger firms to gauge  return-on-investment from a larger pool of enrollees. With fewer resources  available to fund expansive wellness programs, smaller businesses need a  cost-effective mechanism to provide such benefits. As the most accessible  healthcare provider, community pharmacists are in an ideal position to support  certain wellness programs for smaller businesses. This research piloted a  community pharmacist-led, employer-sponsored wellness program for a self-insured  financial services company in Tennessee. Employees with diabetes, hypertension,  hyperlipidemia, asthma, or COPD were recruited from the partnering firm to  receive live, one-on-one counseling from a community pharmacist over a calendar  year. Each session was tailored to individual employee's needs and goals but  generally focused on medication adherence, diet, exercise, and health maintenance  strategies. Fifteen employees participated in the program, and improvements in  clinical measures were not realized over the course of a year. Some, albeit not  statistically significant, improvements were seen in self-reported medication  adherence and quality of life; however, a trend toward some weight gain was  observed. Results suggest that, similar to Medicare beneficiaries, working-age  adults with certain chronic conditions may benefit from pharmacist-led MTM  programs but deeper investigation is needed.

Approvals of new pharmacotherapies that improve function  and reduce morbidity and mortality risks; advances in clinical trial methods,  including long-term, event-driven studies with clinically relevant and  patient-centered endpoints; and trial results support a new therapeutic  management strategy. This new paradigm involves initial treatment with combined  therapies that act through different disease pathways. In addition, 2 new sets of  clinical practice guidelines for PAH have been published since June 2014. Despite  these advances, major gaps have been documented in the diagnosis, treatment, and  management of patients with PAH. OBJECTIVE: To present current knowledge and  evidence on PAH to support managed care professionals and providers in achieving  accurate differential diagnosis, promptly referring patients to specialists as  necessary, and ensuring that patients receive appropriate, guideline-directed  therapies. SUMMARY: Major gaps in the quality of care provided to patients with  PAH include oversights in clinicians' recognition of symptoms, delays in  diagnosis, and misdiagnosis ensuing from incomplete evaluations, delays in  referral of patients to centers of expertise and initiation of therapy, and  inappropriate treatment regimens. To address deficiencies in PAH diagnosis, new  practice guidelines emphasize the essential role of right heart catheterization  in characterizing and confirming the disease, as well as referral to expert  pulmonary hypertension centers to ensure appropriate evaluation and treatment.  Updated disease and functional classifications of PAH, along with new research  findings on prognostic factors and effects of comorbid conditions, offer key  support for making effective therapy and management decisions for patients with  PAH at different risk levels and stages of the disease. Since 2013, the U.S. Food  and Drug Administration has approved new PAH therapies in the classes of  endothelin receptor antagonists, guanylate cyclase stimulators, prostacyclin  analogues, and prostacyclin receptor agonists. As demonstrated through phase 3  clinical trials, these generally well-tolerated therapies delay disease  progression, improve hemodynamic and functional status, and decrease numbers of  hospitalizations. Moreover, 2 sets of recently published guidelines-developed by  the American College of Chest Physicians and the European Society of  Cardiology/European Respiratory Society-provide evidence-based and expert  consensus recommendations for achieving PAH treatment goals. The most recent  guidelines include a recommendation for upfront combination therapy for patients  with moderate disease, which is supported by new comparative clinical trial  evidence. As addressed in this article, these advances in the field of PAH have  important implications for managed care and clinical practice, including  considerations of cost-benefit outcomes associated with different management  strategies.

T2  - Pediatric pulmonology
AB  - The multidisciplinary team in a pediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH) center can improve the delivery of care to the PH patient by helping them address the  different challenges that correlate to a PH diagnosis. Currently, there are a  limited number of accredited pediatric PH centers nationwide, and many healthcare  facilities have little experience managing patients with this complex and rare  disease. Patients with PH may see providers from multiple medical specialties,  inherit a high-cost burden from their PH medications, and have little community  backing due to unfamiliarity of the disease. The multidisciplinary team can  embrace these challenges. Through the delineation of tasks and roles within the  composition of the team, patients can experience the support, resources, and care  they need. The composition of the team can vary from center to center, but it may  include an attending physician, advanced practice provider, nurse, dietitian,  physiologists, respiratory therapists, social workers, research coordinators, and  subspecialty collaboration including cardiology, pulmonology, genetics,  psychology, and palliative care. When composing a multidisciplinary team,  consider the heterogeneity of the patient population being served. Look at the  resources available and overall community familiarity with PH. It is important to  know the center's limits and refer to an expert PH center as necessary. The goal  for every patient with pulmonary hypertension is to maximize their quality of  life and outcomes, and the use of the multidisciplinary team is one approach to  reaching this goal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Health Insurance Service in South Korea has conducted a telephone outreach program to improve medication adherence for hypertension and  diabetes patients since 2014. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the direct outcomes of the  program. METHODS: Patients were identified among those who visited an outpatient  clinic at least twice or used an inpatient service at least once for hypertension  or diabetes during 6-month intervals and who were nonadherent based on the  proportion of days covered (PDC) calculated. As a preliminary intervention,  participants were mailed an information leaflet on their own medication adherence  and other tips for effective self-management of chronic diseases. For the  intervention, two phone calls and three phone messages were made to patients by  24 participating regional offices. Ultimately, 2,428 hypertension patients and  884 diabetes patients received the intervention. Propensity matching was used  based on age, sex, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index to select 12,140  hypertension and 4,420 diabetes patients as controls in the non-participating  regions. The outcome was PDC. Multivariate ordinary least squares or logistic  regression analysis were used with difference-in-difference specification.  RESULTS: The adjusted quarterly PDC increased by 1.96%p for hypertension  (p = 0.023) and by 7.79%p for diabetes patients (p < 0.001). Approximately 40.6%  and 51.7% of hypertension and diabetes patients in the treatment arm (p = 0.0069)  became adherent after the intervention, whereas the corresponding proportions  were 37.7% and 41.4% (p < 0.001) in the control group. Both treatment groups  showed a higher likelihood of good medication adherence (hypertension: odds  ratio = 1.157, 95% CI [1.058, 1.265]; diabetes: odds ratio = 1.532, 95% CI  [1.323, 1.774]). The control group, who received only a print intervention with a  mailed leaflet, also showed a dramatic increase in medication adherence.  CONCLUSIONS: An insurer-coordinated telephone-administered program resulted in  improvement of medication adherence among patients with hypertension and  diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension remains poorly controlled on the population level. National rates of control, even when defined leniently by BP < 140/90 mm Hg, are  only ~50%. As growing healthcare costs coincide with tighter blood pressure (BP)  targets, innovative management programs are needed to maximize efficiency of care  delivery and optimize control. HYPOTHESIS: We aimed to develop a remote,  navigator-led hypertension innovation program that would leverage algorithmic  care pathways, home BP measurements and patient coaching to allow rapid and  complete medication titration. METHODS: A multidisciplinary group of clinical  experts from subspecialties and primary care collaborated to develop an  evidence-based clinical algorithm, designed to be automated and administered by  non-licensed patient navigators. In the development stage, a prospective pilot  cohort of 130 patients was managed by nurse practitioners and pharmacists to  ensure efficacy and safety. Patients with clinic BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg were enrolled  and given a Bluetooth-enabled BP device. Home BPs were transmitted automatically  into the electronic medical record. Medication titrations were performed by phone  at biweekly intervals, based upon weekly average BP, until home BP was controlled  at <135/85 mm Hg. RESULTS: Eighty-one percent of all enrolled, and 91% of those  patients who regularly measured home BP achieved goal, in an average of 7 weeks.  Control was reached similarly across races, genders, and ages. CONCLUSIONS: A  home-based BP control program run by non-physicians can provide efficient,  effective and rapid control, suggesting an innovative paradigm for hypertension  management. This program is effective, sustainable, adaptable, and scalable to  fit current and emerging national systems of healthcare.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Veterans Health Administration implemented a pilot program for primary care intensive management (PIM) for patients at high risk for  hospitalization. We examined the impact of the program on medication adherence  and adjustments for patients with chronic conditions. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized  quality improvement trial was conducted in 5 sites in which high-risk patients  were randomized into PIM or usual primary care; outcomes were measured in the 12  months before and after randomization. Interdisciplinary PIM teams assessed  patients for unmet needs and offered services including pharmaceutical care and  care coordination. METHODS: Outcomes included adherence, measured by proportion  of days covered, and several measures of medication adjustments for diabetes,  depression, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension medications.  Differences-in-differences methods were used to estimate changes in outcomes  between PIM and usual care groups. RESULTS: There were 1527 patients in the  medication adherence cohort and 1719 in the medication adjustments cohort. Mean  adherence was mostly similar between groups but 16% higher among PIM patients for  dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (for diabetes) after randomization  (0.12 vs -0.04; P = .02). The mean number of hyperlipidemia drugs filled was  higher among PIM patients (1.1 vs 1.0; P = .006). The mean number of discontinued  depression medications was higher and the mean number of dose changes for  hypertension medications was lower for PIM patients, although these comparisons  did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Medication adherence  improved for DPP-4 inhibitors, and more hyperlipidemia drugs were prescribed for  PIM patients. Overall impacts of PIM were modest.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the treatment of coronary heart disease, secondary prevention goals are still often unmet and poor adherence to prescribed drugs has been  suggested as one of the reasons. We aimed to investigate whether pharmaceutical  care by a pharmacist at the cardiology clinic trained in motivational  interviewing improves clinical outcomes and patient adherence. METHODS: This was  a prospective, randomized, controlled, outcomes-blinded trial designed to compare  pharmaceutical care follow-up with standard care. After standard follow-up at the  cardiology clinic, patients in the intervention group were seen by a clinical  pharmacist two to five times as required over seven months. Pharmacists were  trained to use motivational interviewing in the consultations and they tailored  their support to each patient's clinical needs and beliefs about medicines. The  primary study end-point was the proportion of patients who reached the treatment  goal for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 12 months after discharge. The  key secondary outcome was patient adherence to lipid-lowering therapy at  15 months after discharge, and other secondary outcomes were the effects on  patient adherence to other preventive drugs, systolic blood pressure,  disease-specific quality of life, and healthcare use. RESULTS: 316 patients were  included. The proportion of patients who reached the target for low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol were 37.0% in the intervention group and 44.2% in the  control group (P = .263). More intervention than control patients were adherent  to cholesterol-lowering drugs (88 vs 77%; P = .033) and aspirin (97 vs 91%;  P = .036) but not to beta-blocking agents or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system  inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Our intervention had no positive effects on risk factors  for CHD, but it increased patient adherence. Further investigation of the  intervention process is needed to explore the difference in results between  patient adherence and medication effects. Longer follow-up of healthcare use and  mortality will determine if the increased adherence per se eventually will have a  meaningful effect on patient health.

AB  - PURPOSE: A telehealth-based chronic disease management program including clinical pharmacy specialists (CPSs) and the program's impact on primary care outcomes in  a population of veterans are described. SUMMARY: A telehealth program including  CPS services was developed to improve healthcare access and quality for veterans  in rural areas of the Pacific Northwest. Outcomes of medication management  services provided by a CPS team during both clinical video telehealth and  telephone encounters with 554 patients from October 2014 to March 2017 were  assessed. Patients were targeted for diabetes (DM), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and  hypertension (HTN) control and tobacco cessation; the respective primary outcomes  were the mean changes from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and  blood pressure values and rates of guideline-indicated statin therapy and tobacco  cessation. Patients in the DM and HTN groups had a mean absolute HbA(1c)  reduction of 1.61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-1.83%; p < 0.0001) and a  mean systolic blood pressure reduction of 26.00 mm Hg (95% CI, 22.99-28.50 mm Hg;  p < 0.001), respectively. In the HLD group, 93% of patients were discharged on a  lipid-lowering medication. Tobacco cessation was achieved in 42% of targeted  patients. CONCLUSION: CPSs providing primary care comprehensive medication  management services solely via telehealth improved disease management and access  to healthcare in a population of rural veterans. Statistically significant  improvements in DM and HTN outcomes were demonstrated along with clinically  significant improvements in the areas of lipid management and tobacco cessation.

AB  - Little is known about self-rated health (SRH) of older people living in more remote and Arctic areas. Iceland is a high-income country with one of the lowest  rates of income inequality in the world, which may influence SRH. The research  aim was to study factors affecting SRH, in such a population living in Northern  Iceland. Stratified random sample according to the place of residency, age and  gender was used and data collected via face-to-face interviews. Inclusion  criteria included community-dwelling adults ≥65 years of age. Response rate was  57.9% (N = 175), average age 74.2 (sd 6.3) years, range 65-92 years and 57% were  men. The average number of diagnosed diseases was 1.5 (sd 1.3) and prescribed  medications 3.0 (sd 1.7). SRH ranged from 5 (excellent) to 1 (bad), with an  average of 3.26 (sd 1.0) and no difference between the place of residency. Lower  SRH was independently explained by depressed mood (OR = 0.88, 95% CI =  0.80-0.96), higher body mass index (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.87-0.99), number of  prescribed medications (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.78-1.00) and perception of  inadequate income (OR = 0.45, 95% CI = 0.21-0.98). The results highlight the  importance of physical and mental health promotion for general health and for  ageing in place and significance of economic factors as predictors of SRH.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We developed a new model of hypertension care for non-Hispanic black men that links health promotion by barbers to medication management by American  Society of Hypertension-certified pharmacists and demonstrated efficacy in a  6-month cluster-randomized trial. The marked reduction in systolic blood pressure  (BP) seen at 6 months warranted continuing the trial through 12 months to test  sustainability, a necessary precondition for implementation research. METHODS: We  enrolled a cohort of 319 black male patrons with systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg at  baseline. Fifty-two Los Angeles County barbershops were assigned to either a  pharmacist-led intervention or an active control group. In the intervention  group, barbers promoted follow-up with pharmacists who prescribed BP medication  under a collaborative practice agreement with patrons' primary care providers. In  the control group, barbers promoted follow-up with primary care providers and  lifestyle modification. After BP assessment at 6 months, the intervention  continued with fewer in-person pharmacist visits to test whether the intervention  effect could be sustained safely for 1 year while reducing pharmacist travel  time. Final BP and safety outcomes were assessed in both groups at 12 months.  RESULTS: At baseline, mean systolic BP was 152.4 mm Hg in the intervention group  and 154.6 mm Hg in the control group. At 12 months, mean systolic BP fell by 28.6  mm Hg (to 123.8 mm Hg) in the intervention group and by 7.2 mm Hg (to 147.4  mm Hg) in the control group. The mean reduction was 20.8 mm Hg greater in the  intervention (95% CI, 13.9-27.7; P<0.0001). A BP <130/80 mm Hg was achieved by  68.0% of the intervention group versus 11.0% of the control group ( P<0.02).  These new 12-month efficacy data are statistically indistinguishable from our  previously reported 6-month data. No treatment-related serious adverse events  occurred in either group over 12 months. Cohort retention at 12 months was 90% in  both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among black male barbershop patrons with uncontrolled  hypertension, health promotion by barbers resulted in large and sustained BP  reduction over 12 months when coupled with medication management by American  Society of Hypertension-certified pharmacists. Broad-scale implementation  research is both justified and warranted. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:  https://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Unique identifier: NCT 02321618.

AB  - Medication synchronization programs based in pharmacies simplify the refill process by enabling patients to pick up all of their medications on a single  visit. This can be especially important for improving medication adherence in  patients with complex chronic diseases. We evaluated the impact of two  synchronization programs on adherence, cardiovascular events, and resource use  among Medicare beneficiaries treated between 2011 and 2014 for two or more  chronic conditions-at least one of which was hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or  diabetes. Among nearly 23,000 patients matched by propensity score, the mean  proportion of days covered (a measure of medication adherence) for the control  group of patients without a synchronization program was 0.84 compared to 0.87 for  synchronized patients-a gain of 3 percentage points. Adherence improvement in  synchronized versus control patients was three times greater in patients with low  baseline adherence, compared to those with higher baseline adherence. Rates of  hospitalization and emergency department visits and rates of outpatient visits  were 9 percent and 3 percent lower in the synchronized group compared to the  control group, respectively, while cardiovascular event rates were similar.  Synchronization programs were associated with improved adherence for patients  with cardiovascular disease, especially those with low baseline adherence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To examine current patterns of hypertension (HTN) treatment in the United States, including blood pressure (BP) control, prevalence of different  antihypertensive agents, and variations in treatment associated with patient and  physician characteristics. METHODS: We used data from the National Disease and  Therapeutic Index (NDTI), a nationally representative physician survey produced  by QuintilesIMS. We selected patients with a diagnosis of HTN and identified  those prescribed antihypertensive therapies. We analyzed the type of  antihypertensive agents prescribed. Extent of BP control, and associated patient  and physician characteristics. We calculated 95% confidence intervals that  accounted for the multistage NDTI sampling design. RESULTS: Among those treated  for HTN in 2014, BP control varied: systolic BP (SBP) ≥160 (15%) vs. SBP 150-159  (9%) vs. SBP 140-149 (19%) vs. SBP 130-139 (26%) vs. SBP <130 (32%). Of those  treated for HTN, 29% used of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs);  24%, thiazide-like diuretics; 22%, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), 21%,  calcium-channel blockers (CCBs); and 19% beta-blockers. Newer drugs had very  limited uptake; no drugs approved after 2002 were used in more than 5% of  patients. Selection of agents varied only modestly by patient and physician  characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of HTN in 2014 predominantly involved  older medications in 5 major classes of drugs: ACEIs, thiazide diuretics, ARBs,  CCBs, and beta-blockers. Selection of antihypertensive agents showed limited  variation by age, gender, race, and insurance type. Although 58% of treated  patients had SBP <140, 24% had poorly controlled HTN with SBP ≥150, indicating  the need for improved treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In 2009 and 2010, 17 primary care sites within 1 healthcare system became patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs), but the sites trained different  personnel (pharmacists vs nurses) to improve diabetes care using self-management  support (SMS). We report the challenges and successes of our efforts to: 1)  assemble a new multipayer (Medicare, Medicaid, commercial) claims dataset linked  to a clinical registry and 2) use the new dataset to perform comparative  effectiveness research on implementation of the 2 SMS models. STUDY DESIGN:  Longitudinal cohort study. METHODS: We lost permission to use private-payer data.  Therefore, we used claims from Medicare fee-for-service and Medicare/Medicaid  dual-eligible patients merged with chronic disease registry data. We studied 2008  to 2010, which included 1 year pre- and 1 year post the 2009 implementation time  period. Outcomes were outpatient and emergency department visits,  hospitalizations, care process (use of statin), and 3 intermediate outcomes  (glycemic control, blood pressure [BP], and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol  [LDL-C]). RESULTS: In our sample of 2826 patients, quality of care improved and  utilization decreased over the 2.5 years. Both approaches improved lipid control  (LDL-C decreased by an average of 4 mg/dL for pharmacy-SMS and 5.6 mg/dL for  nurse-SMS) and diastolic BP (-1.5 mm Hg for pharmacy-SMS and -1.3 mm Hg for  nurse-SMS), whereas only the pharmacy-led approach decreased primary care visits  (by 0.8 visits). The groups differed slightly on 2 measures (glycated hemoglobin,  systolic BP) with respect to the trajectory of improvement over time, but  performance was similar by 2.5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes care improved during  PCMH implementation systemwide, supporting both nurse-led and pharmacist-led SMS  models.

AB  - PURPOSE: Expansion of clinical pharmacist positions through sustainable funding is described. SUMMARY: The University of Colorado Skaggs School of Pharmacy and  Pharmaceutical Sciences was awarded a 2-year program grant to establish an  integrated clinical pharmacy program for underserved residents in family health  centers in northeastern Colorado. The grant enabled the hiring of 2 bilingual,  full-time, board-certified, postgraduate year 2-trained clinical pharmacists to  initiate comprehensive clinical pharmacy services. Clinical pharmacy services for  diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia management were provided during direct  patient care visits using collaborative drug therapy management protocols to  facilitate comprehensive medication management. Initial visits lasted 1 hour, and  follow-up visits lasted 30 minutes. In addition, clinical pharmacists provided  point-of-care consultations for patients seeing other healthcare providers. All  patient encounters and consultations were documented in the electronic health  record. Success of the clinical pharmacy program was evaluated based on the  achievement of goal blood pressure values, glycosylated hemoglobin values, and  low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Pharmacists' involvement in patient  care activities led to improvements in all of these clinical outcomes. This  coincided with unique funding opportunities with regional accountable care  organizations that sought to demonstrate improved patient care in an expansion  population. As a result, 2 grant-funded clinical pharmacist positions in 2  community health clinics were converted into 4 faculty positions in 5 community  health centers funded by regional accountable care organizations. CONCLUSION:  Collaboration with accountable care organizations resulted in the successful  funding of ambulatory care clinical pharmacy services. These services resulted in  improved chronic disease control and provider satisfaction.

AB  - Physician-pharmacist collaboration improves blood pressure, but there is little information on whether this model can reduce the gap in healthcare disparities.  This trial involved 32 medical offices in 15 states. A clinical pharmacist was  embedded within each office and made recommendations to physicians and patients  in intervention offices. The purpose of the present analysis was to evaluate  whether the pharmacist intervention could reduce healthcare disparities by  improving blood pressure in high-risk racial and socioeconomic subjects compared  with the control group. The analyses in minority subjects were prespecified  secondary analyses, but all other comparisons were secondary, post hoc analyses.  The 9-month visit was completed by 539 patients: 345 received the intervention,  and 194 were in the control group. Following the intervention, mean systolic  blood pressure was found to be 7.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 2.4, 12.3)  lower in subjects from racial minority groups who received the intervention  compared with the control group (P=0.0042). Subjects with ≤12 years of education  in the intervention group had a systolic blood pressure 8.1 mm Hg (95% confidence  interval 3.2, 13.1) lower than the control group with lower education (P=0.0001).  Similar reductions in blood pressure occurred in patients with low incomes, those  receiving Medicaid, or those without insurance. This study demonstrated that a  pharmacist intervention reduced racial and socioeconomic disparities in the  treatment of blood pressure. Although disparities in blood pressure were reduced  by the intervention, there were still nonsignificant gaps in mean systolic blood  pressure when compared with intervention subjects not at risk.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since its introduction to the market in 2016, selexipag has been an alternative oral therapy among both treatment-naïve patients and those with mono  or dual therapy failure; however, limited information is available regarding the  presentation and management of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension  (PAH) prior to selexipag initiation. This study examined treatment patterns,  healthcare utilization, and costs in the 12 months prior to and the 6 months  following selexipag initiation. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of adult  commercial and Medicare Advantage with Part D (MAPD) health plan members with a  medical or pharmacy claim for selexipag from 1 January 2016 through 31 May 2017,  a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, and continuous health plan enrollment for  12 months prior to selexipag initiation (baseline period). Treatment patterns,  healthcare utilization, and costs were measured over the baseline period and the  6 months following selexipag initiation (among patients with ⩾6 months of follow  up). RESULTS: After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, 95 patients  were included in the analysis. At study start, 57.9% of patients were prescribed  combination therapy, increasing to 69.5% immediately prior to selexipag  initiation. Approximately 60% of patients had one baseline regimen. Emergency  visits and inpatient admissions during the baseline period occurred in 63.2% and  48.4% of patients, respectively. Baseline medical costs rose steadily, increasing  266.8% in commercial and 26.7% in MAPD enrollees from the beginning to the end of  the 12-month baseline period. PAH-related healthcare costs accounted for more  than 80% of total costs. Mean medical costs in the 6 months following selexipag  initiation were US$17,215 in commercial and US$23,976 in MAPD enrollees.  CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with PAH remained on the same therapy in  the 12 months prior to selexipag initiation despite high rates of healthcare  utilization and increasing costs. Mean medical costs appeared to decrease after  adding or switching to selexipag.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the 4 non-pharmacological strategies adopted by patients for hypertension control and patient characteristics that affect the  choice of strategies. Four thousand hypertensive patients aged ≥18 years were  selected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Odds ratios  of the choice of strategies were analyzed using weighted logistic models.  Clinical recommendations of non-pharmacological strategies for hypertension  control were relatively low. More exercise was the least frequent strategy used  for hypertension control. More patients reported using ≥3 strategies than using  ≤2 strategies (79.1% vs 20.9%, P < .0001). Non-Hispanic blacks were more likely  to use each individual strategy and to use ≥3 strategies simultaneously. Patients  with obesity and diabetes were less likely to attempt weight control or more  exercise, but more likely to use ≥3 strategies than peers. Educational programs  should be developed to enhance physician's advice for lifestyle modifications and  to increase patient's acceptance of physical activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the process of creating precepted, student pharmacist-led health outreach events at long-term care facilities and to describe the lessons  learned during the implementation process. SETTING: Yakima, Washington, a  medically underserved area. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Pharmacy students, supervised  by pharmacist preceptors, conducted health outreach events at local long-term  care facilities on a rotating monthly basis. These students provided  comprehensive medication reviews, blood pressure screenings, and blood glucose  screenings. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Pharmacists providing medication reviews at  long-term care facilities where residents manage their medications can address  polypharmacy by identifying medication discrepancies, determining the  effectiveness of treatment, and improving patient outcomes. Conducting health  outreach events with pharmacy-student involvement includes the added benefit of  providing students with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience before  beginning their clinical Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) rotations  and practice skills described in the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists  Geriatric Pharmacy Curriculum Guide and Pharmacist's Patient Care Process.  RESULTS: Nineteen health outreach events at long-term care facilities were held,  and more than 100 residents participated annually. Students coordinated events  successfully after developing a standardized set of questions, which was  necessary for planning, and identifying someone to act as an event coordinator,  recruiting students and ensuring they were appropriately trained, and creating a  monitoring form to be filled in and shared with the participant. Students learned  key lessons including naming the events appropriately to avoid confusion,  understanding that not all long-term care facilities are alike, deciding how many  students to recruit from each cohort to participate in events, optimizing the  preceptor-to- student ratio, and ensuring preceptors were thorough in their  oversight of students. CONCLUSION: This work described the implementation of  health outreach events conducted by supervised student pharmacists at long-term  care facilities. Health outreach events could be conducted by other colleges or  facilities to provide important medication review and health screening services  for long-term care facilities' residents, as well as providing student  pharmacists with opportunities to learn and practice patient-care related skills.

AB  - Many ischemic stroke patients do not achieve goal blood pressure (BP < 140/90 mm Hg). To identify barriers to post-stroke hypertension management, we examined  healthcare utilization and BP control in the year after index ischemic stroke  admission. This retrospective cohort study included patients admitted for acute  ischemic stroke to a VA hospital in fiscal year 2011 and who were discharged with  a BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. One-year post-discharge, BP trajectories, utilization of  primary care, specialty and ancillary services were studied. Among 265 patients,  246 (92.8%) were seen by primary care (PC) during the 1-year post-discharge; a  median time to the first PC visit was 32 days (interquartile range: 53). Among  N = 245 patients with post-discharge BP data, 103 (42.0%) achieved a mean  BP < 140/90 mm Hg in the year post-discharge. Provider follow-ups were: neurology  (51.7%), cardiology (14.0%), nephrology (7.2%), endocrinology (3.8%), and  geriatrics (2.6%) and ancillary services (BP monitor [30.6%], pharmacy [20.0%],  nutrition [8.3%], and telehealth [8%]). Non-adherence to medications was  documented in 21.9% of patients and was observed more commonly among patients  with uncontrolled compared with controlled BP (28.7% vs 15.5%; P = .02). The  recurrent stroke rate did not differ among patients with uncontrolled (4.2%)  compared with controlled BP (3.8%; P = .89). Few patients achieved goal BP in the  year post-stroke. Visits to primary care were not timely. Underuse of specialty  as well as ancillary services and provider perception of medication non-adherence  were common. Future intervention studies seeking to improve post-stroke  hypertension management should address these observed gaps in care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One approach postulated to improve the provision of health care is effective utilization of team-based care including pharmacists. OBJECTIVE: The  objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive systematic review with  focused meta-analyses to examine the effects of pharmacist-provided direct  patient care on therapeutic, safety, and humanistic outcomes. METHODS: The  following databases were searched from inception to January 2009: NLM PubMed;  Ovid/MEDLINE; ABI/INFORM; Health Business Fulltext Elite; Academic Search  Complete; International Pharmaceutical Abstracts; PsycINFO; Cochrane Database of  Systematic Reviews; National Guideline Clearinghouse; Database of Abstracts of  Reviews of Effects; ClinicalTrials.gov; LexisNexis Academic Universe; and Google  Scholar. Studies selected included those reporting pharmacist-provided care,  comparison groups, and patient-related outcomes. Of these, 56,573 citations were  considered. Data were extracted by multidisciplinary study review teams.  Variables examined included study characteristics, pharmacists'  interventions/services, patient characteristics, and study outcomes. Data for  meta-analyses were extracted from randomized controlled trials meeting  meta-analysis criteria. RESULTS: A total of 298 studies were included. Favorable  results were found in therapeutic and safety outcomes, and meta-analyses  conducted for hemoglobin A1c, LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and adverse drug  events were significant (P < 0.05), favoring pharmacists' direct patient care  over comparative services. Results for humanistic outcomes were favorable with  variability. Medication adherence, patient knowledge, and quality of life-general  health meta-analyses were significant (P < 0.05), favoring pharmacists' direct  patient care. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacist-provided direct patient care has favorable  effects across various patient outcomes, health care settings, and disease  states. Incorporating pharmacists as health care team members in direct patient  care is a viable solution to help improve US health care.

T2  - Pediatric cardiology
AB  - Many pharmacologic therapies are available for treatment of post-coarctectomy hypertension in pediatric patients, which may lead to variability in care.  Evaluation of trends in pharmacotherapy is necessary to evaluate quality of care.  The Pediatric Health Information System database was queried from 2004 to 2013  for patients >30 days of age who had an ICD-9 code for coarctation of the aorta  repair of coarctation by end-to-end anastomosis and had a RACHS-1 score of 2.  Patients were excluded if they were admitted for >30 days, underwent mechanical  circulatory support, or expired during the admission. Patient demographic and  hospital data were collected along with antihypertensive pharmacotherapy. Trends  in antihypertensive, analgesic, and sedative pharmacotherapy were evaluated, and  multivariable statistical analysis was used to determine variables that  significantly influenced cost. A total of 1636 patients [66.6 % male, median age  1.5 years (IQR 0.31-5.3)] met study criteria. Patients received a median of 3  (IQR 2-4) antihypertensive medications for a median of 8 days (IQR 5-11).  Intravenous antihypertensive therapy was prescribed for a median 3 days (IQR 2-5)  and oral therapy for a median of 1 day (IQR 1-2). Antihypertensive therapy was  continued at discharge in 79.8 % of patients. Hospital cost increased by 36 %  over the study period (p < 0.01), and nicardipine, dexmedetomidine, and  intravenous acetaminophen were most strongly associated with increased cost (p <  0.001). Variability in the pharmacotherapy of post-coarctectomy hypertension in  pediatric patients exists, and the use of newer agents may be influencing the  cost of care.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Hypertension and carotid stenosis are both risk factors for stroke, but the presence of carotid stenosis might dampen enthusiasm for tight control of  hypertension because of concerns for hypoperfusion. OBJECTIVE: To determine the  extent to which there are opportunities to potentially improve pharmacotherapy  for hypertension in patients known to have asymptomatic high-grade carotid  stenosis. DESIGN: We examined anti-hypertensive medication prescription and  adherence to evidence-based hypertension treatment guidelines in a  cross-sectional analysis of baseline data of patients enrolled in a clinical  trial. SETTING: The Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for  Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial (CREST-2) is a multicenter prospective  randomized open blinded end-point clinical trial of intensive medical management  with or without revascularization by endarterectomy or stenting for asymptomatic  high-grade carotid stenosis. PARTICIPANTS: 1479 participants (38.6% female; mean  age 69.8 years) from 132 clinical centers enrolled in the CREST-2 trial as of  April 6, 2020 who were taking ≥1 antihypertensive drug at baseline. EXPOSURES:  Pharmacotherapy for hypertension. MAIN OUTCOME: Adherence to evidence-based  guidelines for treating hypertension. RESULTS: Of 1458 participants with complete  data, 26% were on one, 31% on 2, and 43% on ≥3 antihypertensive medications at  trial entry. Thirty-two percent of participants were prescribed thiazide; 74%,  angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker  (ARB); 38%, calcium channel blocker (CCB); 56%, a beta blocker; 11%, loop  diuretic; and 27%, other. Of those prescribed a single antihypertensive  medication, the proportion prescribed thiazide was 5%; ACEI or ARB, 55%, and CCB,  11%. The prevalence of guideline-adherent regimens was 34% (95% CI, 31-36%).  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In a diverse cohort with severe carotid disease and  hypertension, non-adherence to hypertension guidelines was common. All preferred  classes of antihypertensive drug were under-prescribed. Using staged iterative  guideline-based care for hypertension, CREST-2 will characterize drug tolerance  and stroke rates under these conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although medication therapy management (MTM) has specific eligibility criteria and is mandated for specific Medicare Part D enrollees, some health  plans have expanded MTM eligibility beyond the minimum criteria to include other  Medicare Part D enrollees, Medicaid, and commercial health plan patients.  Differences exist in the mode of delivery, location of services, type of  personnel involved in managing the service, and the subsequent outcomes. The type  and intensity of MTM services delivered have evolved with time to more  streamlined and robust interventions, necessitating ongoing evaluation of the  effect on clinical and economic outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of  changes to an existing MTM program on cost of care, utilization, and medication  adherence. METHODS: UPMC Health Plan made changes to an existing MTM program by  expanding eligibility (customized by the type of health plan), intervention  types, pharmacist involvement, and patient followup contacts. After matching our  intervention cohort (identified January 2017-June 2018) with the pre-2016 MTM  historical controls (patients identified January 2014-June 2015 who would have  been eligible if we used the intervention cohort eligibility criteria), we  estimated that the effect of the program changes with a difference-in-difference  model (preintervention [2014-2016] and postintervention [2017-2019]). Outcomes of  interest included cost (total cost of care including medical, pharmacy, and  unplanned care [i.e., unscheduled health care use such as emergency department  visits] in 2017 U.S. dollars); utilization; medication adherence (proportion of  days covered); and return on investment (ROI). Target population included  continuously enrolled patients aged ≥ 21 years in the commercial, Medicare, and  Medicaid health plans. RESULTS: Total propensity score-matched members was  10,747, 55% of which were in the historic control group. The average (SD) ages  after matching the groups were similar (historical control group: 57.08 years  [14.23], intervention group: 56.79 years [14.21]) and the majority was female  (57%). Comorbidities identified most for patients included hypertension (77%),  dyslipidemia (70%), and diabetes (52%). Forty-one percent were in the commercial,  37% in the Medicaid, and 23% in the Medicare health plans. Proportion of care  activities undertaken in the intervention period compared with the control period  were significantly different: "sent letter to physician" (67% vs. 87%), "sent  letter to member" (15% vs. 0%), "pharmacist phone call to physician" (15% vs.  0.1%), and "pharmacist phone call to member" (13% vs. 7%). There were  statistically significant reductions in unplanned care across all health plans  especially in the Medicare population, in total cost of care, and increases in  medication adherence in 4 therapeutic classes: anticoagulants (OR = 1.25, P =  0.005), cardiac medications (OR = 1.20, P < 0.001), statins (OR = 1.21, P <  0.001), and antidepressants (OR = 1.15, P < 0.001). There was a positive ROI of  $18.50 per dollar spent, which equated to a cumulative net savings of $11 million  over 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: In a large health plan, expanding MTM eligibility,  intensifying patient follow-up contact and pharmacist involvement, and improving  provider awareness had favorable clinical and economic benefits. DISCLOSURES:  There was no funding for this project except employees' time. All authors are  employees of UPMC and have no conflicts of interest to report.

AB  - Heart disease and stroke are leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and high blood pressure is a major risk factor for both. Community  pharmacists are readily positioned to improve cardiovascular health through  services such as medication therapy management and self-management education. In  2018, the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health,  and NeuGen, a not-for-profit health insurer, piloted a pharmacist-led medication  therapy management program for people with hypertension in partnership with 8  community pharmacies. We evaluated changes in use of blood pressure  self-management tools and barriers to antihypertensive medication adherence  before and after medication therapy management services. Participant satisfaction  was also assessed for the 59 participants at the end of the program. We observed  improvements in self-reported use of self-management tools, reductions in  medication adherence barriers, and high satisfaction with pharmacist care. This  collaborative pilot resulted in sustainable reimbursement for participating  pharmacies delivering medication therapy management services to eligible NeuGen  members.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of pharmacist-conducted, home-based comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs) on drug therapy problems (DTPs) in  geriatric patients. DESIGN: Pre-/postintervention study. SETTING: Grocery store  chain affiliated with three independent living facilities. PARTICIPANTS:  Twenty-five older adults using pharmacy delivery services for at least three  chronic medications. INTERVENTION: A pharmacist conducted a home-based CMR for  each participant. DTPs were identified across 13 categories. Patients received a  medication action plan post-CMR. A follow-up patient phone call was completed two  weeks following the appointment. Patient profiles were reviewed for three months  postintervention for changes in DTPs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in DTPs per  patient and changes in five Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  triple-weighted Star Rating performance measures. RESULTS: The average DTPs  identified per patient were reduced from 3.4 ± 2.06 to 1.48 ± 1.68 (P < 0.05)  DTPs three months postintervention. The most common categories  identified-nonadherence and incorrect administration/ technique-were  significantly reduced (P = 0.012 and P = 0.010, respectively). One Star Rating  performance measure significantly improved: 68% of patients taking hypertension  medications were adherent at baseline and 91% were adherent three months post-CMR  (P = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-provided, home-based CMRs reduced the average  number of DTPs per patient. The most common categories of DTPs  identified-nonadherence and incorrect administration/technique-were reduced  postintervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes (glycosylated hemoglobin [A1C], blood pressure, and lipids) and other measurements (disease state knowledge, adherence,  and self-efficacy) associated with the use of approved telemonitoring devices to  expand and improve chronic disease management of patients with diabetes, with or  without hypertension. SETTING: Four community health centers (CHCs) in Utah.  PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Federally qualified safety net clinics that provide medical  care to underserved patients. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Pharmacist-led diabetes  management using telemonitoring was compared with a group of patients receiving  usual care (without telemonitoring). INTERVENTIONS: Daily blood glucose (BG) and  blood pressure (BP) values were reviewed and the pharmacist provided phone  follow-up to assess and manage out-of-range BG and BP values. EVALUATION: Changes  in A1C, BP, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) at approximately 6 months were  compared between the telemonitoring group and the usual care group. Patient  activation, diabetes/hypertension knowledge, and medication adherence were  measured in the telemonitoring group. RESULTS: Of 150 patients, 75 received  pharmacist-provided diabetes management and education via telemonitoring, and 75  received usual medical care. Change in A1C was significantly greater in the  telemonitoring group compared with the usual care group (2.07% decrease vs. 0.66%  decrease; P <0.001). Although BP and LDL levels also declined, differences  between the two groups were not statistically significant. Patient activation  measure, diabetes/hypertension knowledge, and medication adherence with  antihypertensives (but not diabetes medications) improved in the telemonitoring  group. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-provided diabetes management via telemonitoring  resulted in a significant improvement in A1C in federally qualified CHCs in Utah  compared with usual medical care. Telemonitoring may be considered a model for  providing clinical pharmacy services to patients with diabetes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to describe medication adherence and medication intensification in a physician-pharmacist collaborative management (PPCM) model  compared with usual care. This study was a prospective, cluster, randomized study  in 32 primary care offices from 15 states. The primary outcomes were medication  adherence and anti-hypertensive medication changes during the first 9 months of  the intervention. The 9-month visit was completed by 539 patients, 345 of which  received the intervention. There was no significant difference between  intervention and usual care patients in regards to medication adherence at  9 months. Intervention patients received significantly more medication changes  (4.9 vs.1.1; P = .0003) and had significantly increased use of diuretics and  aldosterone antagonists when compared with usual care (P = .01).The PPCM model  increased medication intensification; however, no significant change in  medication adherence was detected. PPCM models will need to develop non-adherence  identification and intervention methods to further improve the potency of the  care team.

INTERVENTION: Trained pharmacist-technician teams implemented a  6-month intervention using scheduled visits, Brief Medication Questionnaires  (BMQs), and novel toolkits for facilitating medication adherence and pharmacist  feedback to patients and physicians. Control participants received patient  information only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Refill adherence (≥80% days covered) and  changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and blood  pressure control using blinded assessments at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: At  baseline, all patients had blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more. Of those  eligible, 79% activated the intervention (mean 4.25 visits). Compared with  control participants at 6 months, TEAM participants achieved greater improvements  in refill adherence (60% vs. 34%, P < 0.001), SBP (-12.62 vs. -5.31 mm Hg, P <  0.001), and blood pressure control (50% vs. 36%, P = 0.01). Six months after  intervention discontinuation, TEAM participants showed sustained improvements in  refill adherence ( P < 0.001) and SBP ( P = 0.004), though the difference in  blood pressure control was not significant ( P < 0.05) compared with control  participants. Analysis of intervention fidelity showed that patients who received  the full intervention during months 1 through 6 achieved significantly greater 6-  and 12-month improvements in refill adherence and blood pressure control compared  with control participants. CONCLUSION: A team-based intervention involving  community chain pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and novel toolkits led to  significant and sustained improvements in refill adherence and SBP in black  patients with hypertension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication adherence is essential to optimizing blood pressure (BP) control. Prior research has demonstrated differences in pharmacy refill patterns  according to antihypertensive drug class. No prior study has assessed the  association between drug class and day-to-day adherence. METHODS: Between 2011  and 2014, we enrolled a convenience sample of 149 patients with persistently  uncontrolled hypertension from two inner-city clinics and concurrently measured  adherence of up to four antihypertensive medications using electronic pillboxes  during the interval between two primary care visits. The main outcome was mean  percent of days adherent to each drug. Mixed effects regression analyses were  used to assess the association between drug class and adherence adjusting for  age, gender, race, ethnicity, education, health insurance, coronary artery  disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, number of medications,  days monitored, and dosing frequency. RESULTS: The mean age was 64 years; 72%  women, 75% Hispanic, 88% prescribed ≥ 1 BP medication. In unadjusted analyses,  adherence was lower for beta-blockers (70.9%) compared to angiotensin receptor  blocking agents (75.0%, P = 0.11), diuretics (75.9%, P < 0.001), calcium channel  blockers (77.6%, P < 0.001) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (78.0%,  P < 0.0001). In the adjusted analysis, only dosing frequency (P = 0.0001) but not  drug class (P = 0.71) was associated with medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS:  Antihypertensive drug class was not associated with electronically measured  adherence after accounting for dosing frequency amongst patients with  uncontrolled hypertension. Low adherence to beta-blockers may have been due to  the common practice of prescribing multiple daily dosing. Providers may consider  using once daily formulations to optimize adherence and should assess adherence  among all treated patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Poor blood pressure (BP) control is a primary risk factor for target organ damage in the heart, brain, and kidney. Uncontrolled hypertension is common  among emergency department (ED) patients, particularly in underresourced  settings, but it is unclear what role ED providers should play in the management  of chronic antihypertensive therapy. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to evaluate  the safety and efficacy of prescribing antihypertensive therapy from the ED.  METHODS: This was a retrospective study of data pooled from two prospective,  longitudinal, randomized controlled trials, both of which enrolled ED patients  with asymptomatic hypertension. Antihypertensives were prescribed at emergency  physician discretion, and this was not related to randomization arm. Demographic  data, BP at screening and randomization visit, and data on adverse effects  potentially related to antihypertensive therapy were compiled. Means were  compared using Student's t-tests, and proportions were compared using chi-square  tests. The effect of antihypertensive therapy on BP control was further analyzed  using multivariable regression modeling controlling for age, race, sex,  hypertension history, study cohort, and ED BP. RESULTS: Data were abstracted for  217 subjects. The median interval from ED visit to randomization was 12 days.  Seventy-six subjects (35%) received one or more prescriptions for  antihypertensive therapy. Age, sex, race, hypertension history, and mean duration  of hypertension were equivalent between groups. Although mean ED BP was higher  among those who received prescriptions, the mean systolic BP (sBP) reduction from  ED to randomization was significantly greater (difference = 19 mm Hg, 95%  confidence interval = 12 to 26 mm Hg). No patient in either group had an sBP less  than 100 mm Hg at randomization. On multiple regression modeling, randomization  sBP reduction was independently associated with antihypertensive prescription  (p = 0.001). The incidence of adverse effects was equivalent and low in both  groups. No new neurological deficits, ischemic events, or life-threatening  anaphylactic reactions were reported in either group. CONCLUSIONS: Prescription  of antihypertensive medication from the ED is associated with significantly lower  sBP at short-term outpatient follow-up. Antihypertensive therapy was not  associated with an increased incidence of adverse events, and BP reduction did  not exceed potentially harmful levels. Initiation of chronic antihypertensive  therapy in the ED is safe and effective and may be a reasonable consideration for  at-risk populations.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Hypertension control for large populations remains a major challenge. OBJECTIVE: To describe a large-scale hypertension program in Northern California  and to compare rates of hypertension control in that program with statewide and  national estimates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The Kaiser Permanente Northern  California (KPNC) hypertension program included a multifaceted approach to blood  pressure control. Patients identified as having hypertension within an integrated  health care delivery system in Northern California from 2001-2009 were included.  The comparison group comprised insured patients in California between 2006-2009  who were included in the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set  (HEDIS) commercial measurement by California health insurance plans participating  in the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) quality measure reporting  process. A secondary comparison group was included to obtain the reported  national mean NCQA HEDIS commercial rates of hypertension control between  2001-2009 from health plans that participated in the NCQA HEDIS quality measure  reporting process. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hypertension control as defined by  NCQA HEDIS. RESULTS: The KPNC hypertension registry included 349,937 patients  when established in 2001 and increased to 652,763 by 2009. The NCQA HEDIS  commercial measurement for hypertension control within KPNC increased from 43.6%  (95% CI, 39.4%-48.6%) to 80.4% (95% CI, 75.6%-84.4%) during the study period  (P < .001 for trend). In contrast, the national mean NCQA HEDIS commercial  measurement increased from 55.4% to 64.1%. California mean NCQA HEDIS commercial  rates of hypertension were similar to those reported nationally from 2006-2009  (63.4% to 69.4%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among adults diagnosed with  hypertension, implementation of a large-scale hypertension program was associated  with a significant increase in hypertension control compared with state and  national control rates. Key elements of the program included a comprehensive  hypertension registry, development and sharing of performance metrics,  evidence-based guidelines, medical assistant visits for blood pressure  measurement, and single-pill combination pharmacotherapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of a physician-led point of care medication delivery system (POCMDS) on adherence to glucose, blood pressure, and  cholesterol-lowering medications. STUDY DESIGN: Prepost intervention  observational study. METHODS: From December 15, 2010, to December 14, 2012, we  conducted a prepost analyses of 800 Medicare Advantage members receiving care in  a network of capitated clinics in south Florida serving a predominantly minority  population. Eligibility criteria included a diagnosis of diabetes for at least 1  year, taking at least 1 of the 3 classes of medications, and having received care  in the clinic network for at least for 12 months before and after the POCMDS  implementation. Our primary outcome is the medication possession ratio  (proportion of days covered [PDC]) for each class of medication. RESULTS: We  found an absolute increase of 17 percentage points (95% CI, 13-20) in the PDC for  oral antidiabetic agents, 29 (95% CI, 26-32) for cholesterol medications, and 21  (95% CI, 19-23) for blood pressure medications. Most of the subjects (80%)  reported POCMDS was more convenient than using retail pharmacies. By having the  POCMDS prioritize generic medications, the increases in adherence were not  associated with increased pharmacy costs. At baseline, over half the patients  were at goal for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycated hemoglobin, and  systolic blood pressure; thus, we did not detect any additional improvements in  these intermediate clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Among elderly minority  patients with diabetes, a POCMDS improved adherence to various medications  classes without increasing pharmacy costs. Thus, POCMDS may be of interest to  policy makers, particularly in our current era of healthcare reform.

T2  - Journal of the American Dietetic Association
AB  - It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that medical nutrition therapy and lifestyle counseling are integral components of medical treatment for  the management of selected conditions for which pharmacotherapy is indicated. The  Association promotes a team approach to care for clients receiving  pharmacotherapy and encourages active collaboration among dietetics professionals  and other members of the health care team. Numerous chronic medical conditions  respond to medical nutrition therapy; however, pharmacotherapy may be needed to  achieve control. In some cases, medical nutrition therapy and pharmacotherapy may  need to be initiated simultaneously. Medical nutrition therapy is critical to the  management of a variety of chronic diseases, is effective in managing disease,  and is cost-effective. The use of a coordinated multidisciplinary team effort is  critical to the success of medical nutrition therapy and pharmacotherapy. Because  medical nutrition therapy with pharmacotherapy is a treatment of long duration  that requires monitoring of compliance and effectiveness, it is best accomplished  through a team approach.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) discharged from the Clinical Pharmacy Cardiac Risk Service (CPCRS) would maintain  their lipid goals with use of an electronic laboratory reminder system. STUDY  DESIGN: A 2-year, randomized study at Kaiser Permanente Colorado. METHODS:  Patients with prior CAD (acute myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass  graft surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention) who had been enrolled in the  CPCRS for at least 1 year and who had 2 consecutive low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (LDL-C), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood pressure  readings at goal within 6 months before enrollment were randomized to remain in  the CPCRS (CPCRS care) or to receive usual care from primary care physicians plus  laboratory reminder letters (usual care). The primary outcome was maintenance of  LDL-C goal at study end. The t test and chi(2) test of association were used to  assess differences in mean and categorical values, respectively. RESULTS: A total  of 421 patients (214 CPCRS care, 207 usual care) were randomized. Their mean age  was 72 years; 74% were male. After 1.7 years of follow-up, the proportions of  patients maintaining their LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dL were 91% and 93.1% in the  CPCRS care and usual care groups, respectively (P = .46). The proportions  maintaining their LDL-C goal of <70 mg/dL were 68.6% and 56.8% in the CPCRS care  and usual care groups, respectively (P = .23). CONCLUSION: This study  demonstrated that LDL-C measures can remain controlled in most patients  discharged from a cardiac disease management program.

AB  - Elevated blood pressure (BP) is common in the emergency department (ED), but the relationship between antihypertensive medication adherence and BP in the ED is  unclear. This cross-sectional study tested the hypothesis that higher  antihypertensive adherence is associated with lower systolic BP (SBP) in the ED  among adults with hypertension who sought ED care at an academic hospital from  July 2012 to April 2013. Biochemical assessment of antihypertensive adherence was  performed using a mass spectrometry blood assay, and the primary outcome was  average ED SBP. Analyses were stratified by number of prescribed  antihypertensives (<3, ≥3) and adjusted for age, sex, race, insurance, literacy,  numeracy, education, body mass index, and comorbidities. Among 85 patients  prescribed ≥3 antihypertensives, mean SBP for adherent patients was 134.4 mm Hg  (±26.1 mm Hg), and in adjusted analysis was -20.8 mm Hg (95% confidence interval,  -34.2 to -7.4 mm Hg; P=0.003) different from nonadherent patients. Among 176  patients prescribed <3 antihypertensives, mean SBP was 135.5 mm Hg (±20.6 mm Hg)  for adherent patients, with no difference by adherence in adjusted analysis (+2.9  mm Hg; 95% confidence interval, -4.7 to 10.5 mm Hg; P=0.45). Antihypertensive  nonadherence identified by biochemical assessment was common and associated with  higher SBP in the ED among patients who had a primary care provider and health  insurance and who were prescribed ≥3 antihypertensives. Biochemical assessment of  antihypertensives could help distinguish medication nonadherence from other  contributors to elevated BP and identify target populations for intervention.

T2  - Journal of managed care pharmacy : JMCP
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the subject of quality improvement principles and methods applied to pharmacy services and to describe a framework  for current and future efforts in pharmacy services quality improvement and  effective drug therapy management. BACKGROUND: The Academy of Managed Care  Pharmacy produced the Catalog of Pharmacy Quality Indicators in 1997, followed by  the Summary of National Pharmacy Quality Measures in February 1999. In April  2002, AMCP introduced Pharmacy's Framework for Drug Therapy Management in the  21st Century. The Framework documents include a self-assessment tool that details  more than 250 specific "components" that describe tasks, behaviors, skills,  functions, duties, and responsibilities that contribute to meeting customer  expectations for effective drug therapy management. FINDINGS: There are many  opportunities for quality improvement in clinical, service, and cost outcomes  related to drug therapy management. These may include patient safety; incidence  of medical errors; adverse drug events; patient adherence to therapy; attainment  of target goals of blood pressure, glucose, and lipid levels; risk reduction for  adverse cardiac events and osteoporotic-related fractures; patient satisfaction;  risk of hospitalization or mortality; and cost of care. Health care practitioners  can measure improvements in health care quality in several ways including (a) a  better patient outcome at the same cost, (b) the same patient outcome at lower  cost, (c) a better patient outcome at lower cost, or (d) a significantly better  patient outcome at moderately higher cost. Measurement makes effective management  possible. A framework of component factors (e.g., tasks) is necessary to  facilitate changes in the key processes and critical factors that will help  individual practitioners and health care systems meet customer expectations in  regard to drug therapy, thus improving these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Quality  improvement in health care services in the United States will be made in  incremental changes that rely on a structure-process-outcome model. The structure  is provided by evidence created from controlled randomized trials and other  studies of care and system outcomes that are based on the scientific method. The  process portion is created by the application of evidence in the form of clinical  practice guidelines, clinical practice models, and self-assessment tools such as  Pharmacy's Framework for Drug Therapy Management. Incremental changes in  structure and process will result in the desirable outcome of meeting customer  needs for more effective drug therapy and disease management.

METHODS: The study population consisted of 6219  residents of the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan area who were  hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction in 6 annual periods between 1995  and 2005. Patients were categorized as having preserved kidney function (n=3154),  mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (n=2313), or severe chronic kidney  disease (n=752) at the time of hospital admission. RESULTS: Patients with chronic  kidney disease were more likely to be older, to have a greater prevalence of  comorbidities, and to experience significant in-hospital complications or die  during hospitalization in comparison with patients with preserved kidney  function. Although patients with chronic kidney disease were less likely to  receive effective cardiac medications or undergo coronary interventional  procedures than patients without kidney disease, we observed a marked increase in  the use of effective cardiac medications and coronary interventional procedures  in patients with chronic kidney disease during the period under study.  In-hospital death rates declined over time among patients with chronic kidney  disease, whereas these death rates remained unchanged among persons with normal  kidney function. CONCLUSION: The results of this study in residents of a large  New England metropolitan area provide insights into changing trends in the  treatment and impact of chronic kidney disease in patients hospitalized with  acute myocardial infarction.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of medication therapy management on chronic disease management and generic drug prescribing in the clinic setting. METHODS:  Private insurer initiates Pay-for-Performance (PFP) project for clinic-based  pharmacists in Iowa and South Dakota (n = 9 clinics) in 2009. Each pharmacist was  assigned ∽300 patients with at least 1 of 4 disease states (diabetes mellitus,  hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and asthma). Pharmacists were expected to complete  2 medication reviews for each patient. The primary outcome was frequency of  patients achieving goal levels: diabetes: hemoglobin A1c (A1c) <8%, low-density  lipoprotein (LDL) <130 mg/dL, and blood pressure (BP) <140/80 mm Hg;  hypertension: BP <140/90 mm Hg; hyperlipidemia: LDL <130 mg/dL; and asthma:  percentage of persistent asthmatics on controller medication. Generic prescribing  rates were evaluated for antihypertensives, cholesterol-lowering agents, proton  pump inhibitors, and antidepressants. RESULTS: A total of 827 patients at 3  clinics were included in the analysis. For diabetes, 77.1% had A1c <8%, 83.2% had  LDL <130 mg/dL, and 76.3% had BP <140/80 mm Hg. For hypertension, 86.2% had BP  <140/90 mm Hg. For hyperlipidemia, 80.6% had LDL <130 mg/dL. For asthma, 100%  were on controller medication. One medication review was completed on 88.8% of  patients. Generic prescribing rates ranged from 65.8% to 79.4%.  IMPLICATIONS/ADAPTABILITY: A high percentage of patients achieved goal levels at  clinics with clinical pharmacist services. A multidisciplinary approach to  patient care may improve disease state management and medication cost savings.

T2  - Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication therapy management (MTM) was officially recognized by the federal government in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and  Modernization Act of 2003, which requires Medicare Part D plans that offer  prescription drug coverage to establish MTM programs (MTMPs) for eligible  beneficiaries. Even though the term "MTM" was first used in 2003, pharmacists  have provided similar services since the term "pharmaceutical care" was  introduced in 1990. Fairview Health Services, a large integrated health care  system, implemented a standardized pharmaceutical care service system in 1998,  naming it a pharmaceutical care-based MTM practice in 2006. OBJECTIVE: To present  the clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes of 10 years of delivering MTM  services to patients in a health care delivery system. METHODS: Data from MTM  services provided to 9,068 patients and documented in electronic therapeutic  records were retrospectively analyzed over the 10-year period from September 1998  to September 2008 in 1 health system with 48 primary care clinics. Patients  eligible for MTM services were aged 21 years or older and either paid for MTM out  of pocket or met their health care payer's criteria for MTM reimbursement; the  criteria varied for Medicaid, Medicare, and commercially insured enrollees. All  MTM was delivered face to face. Health data extracted from the electronic  therapeutic record by the present study's investigators included patient  demographics, medication list, medical conditions, drug therapy problems  identified and addressed, change in clinical status, and pharmacist-estimated  cost savings. The clinical status assessment was a comparison of the first and  most recent MTM visit to measure whether the patient achieved the goals of  therapy for each medical condition (e.g., the blood pressure of a patient with  diabetes and hypertension will be less than 130/80 millimeters mercury [mmHg] in  1 month; the patient with allergic rhinitis will be relieved of his complaints of  nasal congestion, runny nose, and eye itching within 5 days). Goals were set  according to evidence-based literature and patient-specific targets determined  cooperatively by pharmacists, patients, and physicians. Cost-savings calculations  represented MTM pharmacists' estimates of medical services (e.g., office visits,  laboratory services, urgent care visits, emergency room visits) and lost work  time avoided by the intervention. All short-term (3-month) estimated health care  savings that resulted from addressing drug therapy problems were analyzed. The  expenses of these avoided services were calculated using the health system's  contracted rates for services provided in the last quarter of 2008. The return on  investment (ROI) was calculated by dividing the pharmacist-estimated savings by  the cost of MTM services in 2008 (number of MTM encounters times the average cost  of an MTM visit). The humanistic impact of MTM services was assessed using the  results from the second patient satisfaction survey administered in 2008 (new  patients seen from January through December 2008) for the health system's MTM  program. RESULTS: A total of 9,068 patient records were in the documentation  system as of September 30, 2008. During the 10-year period, there were 33,706  documented encounters (mean 3.7 encounters per patient). Of 38,631 drug therapy  problems identified and addressed by MTM pharmacists, the most frequent were a  need for additional drug therapy (n = 10,870, 28.1%) and subtherapeutic dosage (n  = 10,100, 26.1%). In the clinical status assessment of the 12,851 medical  conditions in 4,849 patients who were not at goal when they enrolled in the  program, 7,068 conditions (55.0%) improved, 2,956 (23.0%) were unchanged, and  2,827 (22.0%) worsened during the course of MTM services. Pharmacist-estimated  cost savings to the health system over the 10-year period were $2,913,850 ($86  per encounter) and the total cost of MTM was $2,258,302 ($67 per encounter), for  an estimated ROI of $1.29 per $1 in MTM administrative costs. In the patient  satisfaction survey, 95.3% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that their  overall health and well-being had improved because of MTM. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist  estimates of the impact of an MTM program in a large integrated health care  system suggest that the program was associated with improved clinical outcomes  and cost savings. Patient satisfaction with the program was high. DISCLOSURES:  There was no external funding for this manuscript. The 3 authors are employees of  Fairview Pharmacy Services. Ramalho de Oliveira had primary responsibility for  the concept and design, writing, and revision of the manuscript, with the  assistance of Brummel and Miller.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have documented factors influencing medication nonadherence among the Medicare population, but few studies have examined  medication nonadherence among the Medicare low-income subsidy (LIS) population.  Furthermore, little is known about the factors associated with nonadherence among  this population, especially those with prevalent chronic conditions such as type  2 diabetes, hypertension, or heart failure. OBJECTIVE: To examine factors  associated with the likelihood of medication nonadherence among Medicare LIS  recipients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, or heart failure. METHODS: This  was a retrospective analysis of 2012-2013 Medicare Parts A, B, and D claims (most  recent available for this research) linked to the Area Health Resources Files.  Beneficiaries aged 65 years or older with continuous Medicare coverage and  receiving any LIS were included. Individuals were categorized into full LIS or  partial LIS groups. Nonadherence was determined by the proportion of days covered  less than 80% for specified oral type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart failure  medications, as defined by the Pharmacy Quality Alliance. A multivariate logistic  regression was used to determine and compare individual-level and community-level  characteristics associated with nonadherence among the entire study sample, the  full LIS group, and the partial LIS group. RESULTS: The study sample included  505,771 Medicare beneficiaries, with 448,509 (88.7%) receiving full LIS and  57,262 (11.3%) receiving partial LIS. The proportion of individuals nonadherent  was higher among the full LIS population (33.2%) than that of the partial LIS  population (30.8%). Among the entire population, younger age was associated with  nonadherence (OR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.98-0.99). Men were more likely to be  nonadherent than women (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.11-1.14). Compared with  non-Hispanic Whites, racial/ethnic minorities had higher nonadherence. Compared  with beneficiaries who were non-Hispanic White, the ORs for those who were Black,  Hispanic, Asian, and other were 1.41 (95% CI = 1.38-1.43), 1.58 (95% CI =  1.55-1.61), 1.08 (95% CI = 1.05-1.11), and 1.63 (95% CI = 1.56-1.70),  respectively. There were higher nonadherence rates among patients living in  communities with lower socioeconomic characteristics, such as a metropolitan  statistical area (MSA vs non-MSA; OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.04-1.07). A higher risk  adjustment summary score, indicating worse health status, was associated with an  increased likelihood of medication nonadherence (OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.20-1.22).  These patterns were similar among the full and partial LIS groups. CONCLUSIONS:  Individual- and community-level characteristics were associated with the  likelihood of medication nonadherence among Medicare LIS recipients with type 2  diabetes, hypertension, or heart failure. These characteristics included younger  age, male sex, racial/ethnic minorities, living in lower socioeconomic  communities, and a higher risk adjustment summary score. This study provided  insight into medication nonadherence within the Medicare LIS population and  identified the need to consider these factors when developing future policies to  improve medication adherence.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Physician-pharmacist collaborative models have been shown to improve the care of patients with numerous chronic medical conditions. Team-based  health care using integrated clinical pharmacists provides one opportunity to  improve quality in health care systems that use population-based financing. In  November 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) requested  that the relative value of pharmacists' work in team-based care needs to be  established. Thus the objective of this study was to describe the components of  pharmacists' work in the management of hypertension with a physician-pharmacist  collaborative model. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of the components of  pharmacists' work in the Collaboration Among Pharmacists and Physicians to  Improve Outcomes Now (CAPTION) study, a prospective, cluster randomized trial.  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: This analysis was intended to provide policymakers  with data and information, using the CAPTION study model, on the time and  intensity of pharmacists' work to understand pharmacists' relative value  contributions in the context of CMS financing and population management aims. The  CAPTION trial was conducted in 32 community-based medical offices in 15 U.S.  states and included 390 patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Blood  pressure was measured by trained study coordinators in each office, and patients  were included in the study if they had uncontrolled blood pressure. Included  patients were randomized to a 9-month intervention, a 24-month intervention, or  usual care. The goal of the pharmacist intervention was to improve blood pressure  control and resolve drug therapy problems impeding progress toward blood pressure  goals. This intervention included medical record review, a structured assessment  with the patient, collaboration to achieve goals of therapy, and patient  follow-up. The two intervention arms (9 and 24 mo) were identical the first 9  months, and that time frame is the focus of this workload evaluation. Pharmacists  completed study encounter forms for every patient encounter and estimated time  spent in pre-visit, face-to-face care, and post-visit activities. Among the 390  patients, there were 2811 encounters with pharmacists that involved 3.44  hours/patient for face-to-face care visits plus 1.55 hours/patient for pre-visit  and post-visit work. Intensity of work was reflected in interventions to resolve  drug therapy problems with patients (43% of encounters) and with physicians (1169  recommendations, of which physicians accepted 1153 [98.6%]), resulting in  improvement of patients' blood pressure goals achieved (from 0% at baseline to  43% at 9 months based on the primary study end point). CONCLUSION: Pharmacists  provided extensive interventions to patients with hypertension. This analysis  provides a framework for health systems, provider groups, and payers to measure  pharmacists' work in value-based financing and population management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if a multimodal intervention composed of patient education, home blood pressure (BP) monitoring, BP measurement reporting to an  interactive voice response (IVR) phone system, and clinical pharmacist follow-up  improves BP control compared with usual care. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study  with patient enrollment, medication consultation and adjustment, remote BP  monitoring, and follow-up at 6 months. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial  was conducted at 3 healthcare systems in Denver, Colorado, including a large  health maintenance organization, a Veterans Affairs medical center, and a county  hospital. At each site, patients with uncontrolled BP were randomized to the  multimodal intervention vs usual care for 6 months, with the primary end point of  BP reduction. RESULTS: Of 338 patients randomized, 283 (84%) completed the study,  including 138 intervention patients and 145 usual care patients. Baseline BP was  higher in the intervention group vs the usual care group (150.5/89.4 vs  143.8/85.3 mm Hg). At 6 months, BPs were similar in the intervention group vs the  usual care group (137.4 vs 136.7 mm Hg, P = .85 for systolic; 82.9 vs 81.1 mm Hg,  P = .14 for diastolic). However, BP reductions were greater in the intervention  group vs the usual care group (−13.1 vs −7.1 mm Hg, P = .006 for systolic; −6.5  vs −4.2 mm Hg, P = .07 for diastolic). Adherence to medications was similar  between the 2 groups, but intervention patients had a greater increase in  medication regimen intensity. CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal intervention of patient  education, home BP monitoring, BP measurement reporting to an IVR system, and  clinical pharmacist follow-up achieved greater reductions in BP compared with  usual care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the potential health and budgetary impacts of implementing a pharmacist-involved team-based hypertension  management model in the United States. RESEARCH DESIGN: In 2017, we evaluated a  pharmacist-involved team-based care intervention among 3 targeted groups using a  microsimulation model designed to estimate cardiovascular event incidence and  associated health care spending in a cross-section of individuals representative  of the US population: implementing it among patients with: (1) newly diagnosed  hypertension; (2) persistently (≥1 year) uncontrolled blood pressure (BP); or (3)  treated, yet persistently uncontrolled BP-and report outcomes over 5 and 20  years. We describe the spending thresholds for each intervention strategy to  achieve budget neutrality in 5 years from a payer's perspective. RESULTS:  Offering this intervention could prevent 22.9-36.8 million person-years of  uncontrolled BP and 77,200-230,900 heart attacks and strokes in 5 years  (83.8-174.8 million and 393,200-922,900 in 20 years, respectively). Health and  economic benefits strongly favored groups 2 and 3. Assuming an intervention cost  of $525 per enrollee, the intervention generates 5-year budgetary cost-savings  only for Medicare among groups 2 and 3. To achieve budget neutrality in 5 years  across all groups, intervention costs per person need to be around $35 for  Medicaid, $180 for private insurance, and $335 for Medicare enrollees.  CONCLUSIONS: Adopting a pharmacist-involved team-based hypertension model could  substantially improve BP control and cardiovascular outcomes in the United  States. Net cost-savings among groups 2 and 3 make a compelling case for  Medicare, but favorable economics may also be possible for private insurers,  particularly if innovations could moderately lower the cost of delivering an  effective intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The burden of diabetes is exceptionally high among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) peoples. The Indian Health Service (IHS) and Tribal  health programs provide education, case management, and advanced practice  pharmacy (ECP) services for AI/ANs with diabetes to improve their health  outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate patient outcomes  associated with ECP use by AI/AN adults with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN: This  observational study included the analysis of IHS data for fiscal years (FY)  2011-2013. Using propensity score models, we assessed FY2013 patient outcomes  associated with FY2012 ECP use, controlling for FY2011 baseline characteristics.  SUBJECTS: AI/AN adults with diabetes who used IHS and Tribal health services  (n=28,578). MEASURES: We compared health status and hospital utilization outcomes  for ECP users and nonusers. RESULTS: Among adults with diabetes, ECP users,  compared with nonusers, had lower odds of high systolic blood pressure [odds  ratio (OR)=0.85, P<0.001] and high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR=0.89,  P<0.01). Among adults with diabetes absent cardiovascular disease (CVD) at  baseline, 3 or more ECP visits, compared with no visits, was associated with  lower odds of CVD onset (OR=0.79, P<0.05). Among adults with diabetes and CVD,  any ECP use was associated with lower odds of end-stage renal disease onset  (OR=0.60, P<0.05). ECP users had lower odds of 1 or more hospitalizations  (OR=0.80, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Findings on positive patient outcomes associated  with ECP use by adults with diabetes may inform IHS and Tribal policies, funding,  and enhancements to ECP services to reduce disparities between AI/ANs and other  populations in diabetes-related morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Costs of chronic disease management for newly insured adults.
AU  - Gilmer, Todd
T2  - Medical care
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Healthcare reform will result in substantial numbers of newly insured, low-income adults with chronic conditions. This paper examines the costs of a  chronic disease management program among newly insured adults with diabetes  and/or hypertension. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Low-income adults with diabetes  and/or hypertension were provided County-sponsored health insurance coverage and  access to disease management. Health econometric methods were used to compare  costs among participants in disease management to nonparticipants, both overall  and in comparison between those who were newly insured versus previously insured  under an alternative County-sponsored insurance product. Costs were also compared  between those who qualified for County-sponsored coverage due to diabetes versus  hypertension. RESULTS: Annual inpatient costs were $1260 lower, and outpatient  costs were $723 greater, among participants in disease management (P<0.001 each).  Participants in disease management without previous County-sponsored coverage had  higher pharmacy costs ($154, P=0.002) than nonparticipants; whereas participants  with diabetes had marginally significant lower overall costs compared with  nonparticipants ($-685, P=0.070). CONCLUSIONS: Disease management was successful  in increasing the use of outpatient services among participants. The offsetting  costs of the program suggest that disease management should be considered for  some newly insured populations, especially for adults with diabetes.

AB  - The burden of diabetes on the health care system mandates efforts to more optimally treat those with the disease and to prevent its development in those at  risk. Early and intensive intervention in patients with diabetes reduces the risk  of microvascular and macrovascular complications and disease progression. Current  challenges in diabetes management include: (1) optimizing the use of currently  available therapies to ensure adequate glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid  control and to reduce complications; (2) educating patients on diabetes  self-management; (3) improving patient adherence to lifestyle and pharmacologic  interventions; (4) reducing barriers to the early use of insulin; and (5)  improving the delivery of health care to people with chronic conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of community pharmacists on clinical outcomes in Hispanic patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: 126 patients were enrolled in  this longitudinal pre/post cohort study that took place in nine community and  four workplace pharmacies in San Antonio, TX. Pharmacists provided education,  point-of-care testing for glycemic and metabolic parameters, clinical assessment,  goal setting, and drug therapy management with physicians. Study outcomes were  changes in glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and accompanying metabolic parameters  (blood pressure, lipid parameters, and body mass index) during a 1-year time  frame. RESULTS: In the overall cohort, A1C was not reduced significantly from  baseline to 12 months (7.8% vs. 7.6%, P = 0.516). However, statistically  significant reductions occurred for fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, and  diastolic blood pressure. None of the other parameters was affected  significantly. In the subgroup of patients not at target values at baseline,  significant reductions occurred for A1C (9.2% vs. 8.6%, P = 0.001), systolic  blood pressure (147 vs. 143 mm Hg, P = 0.031), diastolic blood pressure (91 vs.  87 mm Hg, P < 0.001), triglycerides (259 vs. 219 mg/dL, P < 0.001), LDL  cholesterol (139 vs. 123 mg/dL, P < 0.001), and total cholesterol (237 vs. 222  mg/dL, P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Interventions performed by community pharmacists  are effective in improving clinical outcomes in a Hispanic cohort with diabetes.  Pharmacists' efforts were most successful in patients not at target glycemic and  metabolic levels.

T2  - Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)
AB  - The Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP, mm Hg) Intervention Trial (SPRINT) showed that targeting SBP <120 mm Hg (intensive treatment, mean SBP: 121.5 mm Hg) versus <140  (standard treatment, mean SBP: 134.6 mm Hg) reduced cardiovascular events 25%.  SPRINT has 2 implicit assumptions that could impact future US hypertension  guidelines: (1) standard therapy controlled SBP similarly to that in adults with  treated hypertension and (2) intensive therapy produced a lower mean SBP than in  adults with treated hypertension and SBP <140 mm Hg. To examine these  assumptions, US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009 to 2012  data were analyzed on 3 groups of adults with treated hypertension: group 1  consisted of SPRINT-like participants aged ≥50 years; group 2 consisted of  participants all aged ≥18 years; and group 3 consisted of participants aged ≥18  years excluding group 1 but otherwise similar to SPRINT-like participants except  high cardiovascular risk. Mean SBPs in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 133.0, 130.1, and  124.6, with 66.2%, 72.2%, and 81.9%, respectively, controlled to SBP <140; 68.3%,  74.8%, and 83.4% of the controlled subset had SBP <130. Mean SBPs in those  controlled to <140 were 123.3, 120.9, and 118.9, respectively. Among US adults  with treated hypertension, (1) the SPRINT-like group had higher mean SBP than  comparison groups, yet lower than SPRINT standard treatment group and (2) among  groups 1 to 3 with SBP <140, SBP values were within <3 mm Hg of SPRINT intensive  treatment. SPRINT results suggest that treatment should be continued and not  reduced when treated SBP is <130, especially for the SPRINT-like subset.  Furthermore, increasing the percentage of treated adults with SBP <140 could  approximate SPRINT intensive treatment SBP without lowering treatment goals.

AB  - Patient-centered, multidisciplinary interventions offer one of the most promising strategies to improve blood pressure (BP) control, yet effectiveness trials in  underserved real-world settings are limited. We used a multidisciplinary strategy  to improve hypertension control in an underserved urban practice. We collected  1007 surveys to monitor medication adherence and used weighted generalized  estimating equations to examine trends in BP control. We examined 13,404 visits  from patients with hypertension between August 2010 and February 2014. Overall,  BP control rates increased from 51.0% to 67.4% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.58; 95%  confidence interval, 1.44-1.74) by the end of the intervention phase and were  maintained during the postintervention phase (adjusted odds ratio, 1.60; 95%  confidence interval, 1.41-1.82). Medication adherence scores increased across the  intervention (5.9-6.6; P < .001), but were not sustained at the conclusion of the  study (5.9-6.2; P = .16). A multidisciplinary team approach involving registered  nurses, pharmacists, and physicians resulted in substantial improvements in  hypertension control in a real-world underserved setting.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide a review of the outcomes and costs in patients seen by Clinical Pharmacy Specialist (CPS) Certified Diabetes Educators in ambulatory  care for diabetes management. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review.  METHODS: All patients discharged by a CPS for diabetes management between January  1, 2010, and December 31, 2013, were included. RESULTS: A total of 915 patients  were discharged from CPS services. The majority of patients had type 2 diabetes  (98.7%) and were female (63.1%), Hispanic (53.3%), and on average, were aged 56  years. The patients were seen by the CPS for approximately 5.3 face-to-face  visits, and by their provider for 1.9 face-to-face visits. The average difference  from baseline for glycated hemoglobin was -2.6%, while the average systolic and  diastolic blood pressures improved by -8 mm Hg and -3 mm Hg, respectively. The  major lipid parameters also reported improvement, averaging -23 mg/dL for total  cholesterol, -54 mg/dL for triglycerides, -15 mg/dL for low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, -23 mg/dL for non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C),  and +0.8 mg/dL for HDL-C. Overall, the average difference from baseline to final  visit for the numbers and costs of medications and diabetes supplies per patient  increased slightly. Medication adherence also improved each year in patients with  diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: The CPSs directly impact patient care through improvements  in clinical outcomes. They help patients achieve disease-state goals for  diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia through a variety of clinical  interventions and by promoting medication adherence. These data demonstrate the  significant positive impact to the institution that clinical pharmacy services  have in diabetes management.

AB  - The shift to a value-based health care system has incentivized providers to implement strategies that improve population health outcomes while minimizing  downstream costs. Given their accessibility and expanded clinical care models,  community pharmacists are well positioned to join interdisciplinary care teams to  advance efforts in effectively managing the health of populations. In this  Viewpoints article, we discuss the expanded role of community pharmacists and  potential barriers limiting the uptake of these services. We then explore  strategies to integrate, leverage, and sustain these services in a value-based  economy. Although community pharmacists have great potential to improve  population health outcomes because of their accessibility and clinical  interventions that have demonstrated improved outcomes, pharmacists are not  recognized as merit-based incentive eligible providers and, as a result, may be  underutilized in this role. Additional barriers include lack of formal billing  codes, which limits patient access to services such as hormonal contraception;  fragmentation of Medicare, which prevents alignment of medical and pharmaceutical  costs; and continued fee-for-service payment models, which do not incentivize  quality. Despite these barriers, there are several opportunities for continued  pharmacist involvement in new care models such as patient-centered medical homes  (PCMH), accountable care organizations, and other value-based payment models.  Community pharmacists integrated within PCMHs have demonstrated improved  hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure control, and immunization rates. Likewise, other  integrated, value-based models that used community pharmacists to provide  medication therapy management services have reported a positive return on  investment in overall health care costs. To uphold these efforts and effectively  leverage community pharmacist services, we recommend the following: (a)  recognition of pharmacists as providers to facilitate full participation in  performance-based models, (b) increased integration of pharmacists in emerging  delivery and payment models with rapid cycle testing to further clarify the role  and value of pharmacists, and (c) enhanced collaborative relationships between  pharmacists and other providers to improve interdisciplinary care. DISCLOSURES:  This article was funded by the National Association of Chain Drug Stores. The  authors have no potential conflicts of interest to report.

T2  - Resuscitation
AB  - Up to 20,000 patients annually suffer from spinal cord injury (SCI) and 20% of these die before being admitted to the hospital in the United States as well as  in the European Union. Prehospital management of SCI is of critical importance  since 25% of SCI damage may occur or be aggravated after the initial event.  Prehospital management includes examination of the patient, spinal  immobilisation, careful airway management (intubation, if indicated, using manual  in-line stabilisation), and cardiovascular support (maintenance of mean arterial  blood pressure above 90 mm Hg) and blood glucose levels within the normal range.  It is still not known whether additional specific therapy is useful. Studies have  not demonstrated convincingly that methylprednisolone (MPS) or other  pharmacological agents really have clinically significant and important benefits  for patients suffering from SCI. Recently published statements from the United  States also do not support the therapeutic use of MPS in patients suffering from  SCI in the prehospital setting any more. Moreover, at this stage, it is not known  whether therapeutic hypothermia or any further pharmacological intervention has  beneficial effects or not. Therefore, networks for clinical studies in SCI  patients should be established, as a basic requirement for further improvement in  outcome in such patients.

AU  - Rabbani, Atonu
AU  - Alexander, G. Caleb
T2  - American journal of hypertension
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients are burdened by prescription costs, yet it is not clear whether brand-named fixed-dose combination medicines are less expensive than the  sum of the cost of their generic components. METHODS: We used the Medical  Expenditure Panel Survey, a rigorously conducted, nationally representative,  population-based survey, to examine the out-of-pocket and third party costs  associated with the most commonly prescribed, brand-named fixed-dose combination  antihypertensive drugs. We compared the out-of-pocket and third party cost for a  30-day supply of each of these combination drugs with the sum of these costs for  their individual generic components. RESULTS: Twenty-seven combination  antihypertensive medicines were examined. Overall, combination products had  higher out-of-pocket costs and lower total costs than did the sum of the costs of  their components. For example, the out-of-pocket costs were greater for 24 of 27  combination drugs examined, and the mean increase in monthly out-of-pocket costs  associated with combination therapy was $13.38 (95% confidence interval,  $12.27-14.50). In contrast, the total cost was lower for 23 of the 27 combination  drugs examined, and the mean decrease in monthly total costs was $20.89 (95%  confidence interval, $20.10-21.68). CONCLUSIONS: Given patient burden and  nonadherence from out-of-pocket prescription costs, the clinical benefits of  brand-named fixed-dose combination antihypertensive therapy should be balanced  with their greater out-of-pocket costs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus is a serious health problem associated with an increased mortality and morbidity. The association of improved glycemic control  with sustained decrease in the rate of complications has been shown in randomized  clinical trials. Pharmaceutical care is a relatively new concept in Turkey; yet,  there are no recorded routine pharmaceutical care programs. Therefore, we aimed  to assess the impact of a short pharmaceutical care program conducted in the  community pharmacy setting, on the indices of diabetes care of type 2 diabetic  patients, particularly those regarding glycemic control and high blood pressure  management. SETTING: The study was carried out at eight community pharmacies in  Pendik district of Istanbul. METHOD: All patients who visited any of the eight  pharmacies through the pre-determined 1-week period were questioned for the  presence of type 2 diabetes. Patients who reported to be type 2 diabetic (n = 67)  were informed about the study and invited to involve. During this prospective  longitudinal study, pharmaceutical care was provided to the patients by the same  clinical pharmacist. The 3 month pharmaceutical care period consisted of six  pharmacy visits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main outcome measures were the  improvement in glycemic control and blood pressure control; while, weight  control, self-monitoring of blood glucose, compliance and being under  physician-control were also assessed. RESULTS: The study was conducted on 43  patients who accepted to involve. Fasting blood glucose was lowered by a mean of  23% over 3-months from an initial value of 167.2 mg/dl. Number of patients  reaching the desired blood glucose goals increased from 16.3% to 39.5%. Systolic  and diastolic blood pressures also significantly fell over 3 months (mean  reductions were 10.9 mmHg for the systolic and 9.3 mmHg for the diastolic blood  pressure). Number of patients reaching the desired blood pressure goal increased  from 30.2% to 51.2%. CONCLUSION: Our short-course pharmaceutical care program  yielded measurable improvements in clinical indicators of diabetes and  comorbidity management. The results suggest that the pharmacist is a beneficial  key component of integrated care for patients with type 2 diabetes. We think that  the positive results observed in this first reported pharmaceutical care program  on diabetes in Turkey can be motivating and encouraging for all community  pharmacists.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of an evidence-based, systematic approach to hypertension care involving comanagement of patients by primary care  physicians and clinical pharmacists versus usual care in reducing blood pressure  in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. METHODS: Patients in a staff model  medical group with uncontrolled hypertension were randomized to either a usual  care (UC) or a physician-pharmacist comanagement (PPCM) group. All physicians in  the study received both group and individual education and participated in the  development of an evidence-based hypertension treatment algorithm. Physicians  were then given the names of their patients whose medical records documented  elevated blood pressures (defined as systolic > or = 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic >  or = 90 mm Hg for patients aged < 65 yrs, and systolic > or = 160 mm Hg and/or  diastolic > or = 90 mm Hg for those aged > or = 65 yrs). Patients randomized to  the UC group were managed by primary care physicians alone. Those randomized to  the PPCM group were comanaged by their primary care physician and a clinical  pharmacist, who provided patient education, made treatment recommendations, and  provided follow-up. Blood pressure measurements, antihypertensive drugs, and  visit costs/patient were obtained from medical records. RESULTS: One hundred  ninety-seven patients with uncontrolled hypertension participated in the study.  Both PPCM and UC groups experienced significant reductions in blood pressure  (systolic -22 and -11 mm Hg, respectively, p < 0.01; diastolic -7 and -8 mm Hg,  respectively, p < 0.01). The reduction in systolic blood pressure was greater in  the PPCM group after adjusting for differences in baseline blood pressure between  the groups (p < 0.01). More patients achieved blood pressure control in the PPCM  than in the UC group (60% vs 43%, p = 0.02). Average provider visit costs/patient  were higher in the UC than the PPCM group ($195 vs $160, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS:  An evidence-based, systematic approach using physician-pharmacist comanagement  for patients with uncontrolled hypertension resulted in improved blood pressure  control and reduced average visit costs/patient.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Taking medications as prescribed is imperative for their effectiveness. In populations such as Medicare, where two thirds of Medicare  beneficiaries have at least 2 or more chronic conditions requiring treatment with  medications and account for more than 90% of Medicare health care spend,  examining ways to improve medication adherence in patients with comorbidities is  warranted. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of pharmacy dispensing channel  (home delivery or retail pharmacy) with medication adherence for Medicare  patients taking medications with comorbid conditions of diabetes, hypertension,  and high blood cholesterol (3 of the top 5 most prevalent conditions), while  controlling for various confounders. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was  conducted using de-identified pharmacy claims data from a large national pharmacy  benefits manager between October 2010 and December 2012. Continuously eligible  Medicare Part D patients (Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan and  Prescription Drug Plan only) aged 65 years or older who had an antidiabetic,  antihypertensive, and antihyperlipidemic prescription claim between October and  December 2010 were identified and analyzed over a 2-year period. Multivariate  logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between dispensing  channel (DC) and medication adherence in calendar year (CY) 2012 controlling for  prior adherence behavior (adherence in CY2011), differences in demographics,  low-income subsidy status, days supply, disease burden, and drug-use pattern.  Patients with a proportion of days covered (PDC) of at least 80% for each of the  3 conditions were considered to be adherent, and patients with PDC less than 80%  for each of the 3 conditions were considered to be nonadherent. Patients were  assigned to a DC depending on where they filled at least 66.7% of their  prescriptions for each of the 3 conditions, and the rest were assigned to a mixed  channel group. RESULTS: The final analytical sample consisted of 40,632 patients.  The adjusted odds of adherence for patients using home delivery were 1.59 (95% CI  = 1.40-1.80) higher compared with patients using retail channels to obtain their  prescriptions. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare Part D patients taking medications for  comorbid conditions who used home delivery had a greater likelihood (adjusted) of  adherence than patients who filled their antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and  antihyperlipidemic prescriptions using retail channels. Managed care stakeholders  looking to make informed decisions in a cost-constrained environment to assess,  implement, and promote solutions that improve health outcomes should consider the  use of home delivery of prescriptions to improve adherence for Medicare Part D  patients with comorbid conditions. DISCLOSURES: Funding for this study was  provided internally by Express Scripts Holding Company. Iyengar, LeFrancois,  Henderson, and Rabbitt are employees of Express Scripts. Study concept and design  were created by Iyengar and LeFrancois. Iyengar was responsible for acquisition  of data, statistical analysis, and interpretation of data. The manuscript was  written by Iyengar and LeFrancois and revised by all the authors.

AB  - Outdated and biased attitudes and care standards impede optimal care of hypertension in African Americans. The negative expectations that blood pressure  targets cannot be reached must be overcome by systematic and appropriate  education and treatment. However, physicians should expect that (1) African  American patients with elevated blood pressure benefit from early and intensive  management, (2) blood pressure can be maintained at goal with appropriate  therapeutic lifestyle changes and medications, and (3) complications related to  high blood pressure can be avoided. To bring blood pressure down to the target  goal, combination pharmacologic therapy is often required. When extensive efforts  to achieve blood pressure control prove unattainable in the primary care setting,  consultation with a hypertension specialist should be considered.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of a telephone call reminder program provided by a campus-based medication therapy management call center on medication  adherence in Medicare Advantage Part D (MAPD) beneficiaries with hypertension.  METHODS: The reminder call services were offered to eligible MAPD beneficiaries,  and they included a live interactive conversation with patients to assess the use  of their medications. This study used a quasi-experimental design for comparing  the change in medication adherence between the intervention and matched control  groups. Adherence, defined by proportion of days covered (PDC), was measured  using incurred medication claims 6 months before and after the adherence program  was implemented. A difference-in-differences approach with propensity score  matching was used. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, paired samples  included 563 patients in each of the intervention and control groups. The mean  PDC (standard deviation) increased significantly during postintervention period  by 17.3% (33.6; P <0.001) and 13.8% (32.3; P <0.001) for the intervention and the  control groups, respectively; the greater difference-in-differences increase of  3.5% (36.3) in the intervention group over the control group was statistically  significant (P = 0.022). A generalized estimating equation model adjusting for  covariates further confirmed that the reminder call group had a significant  increase in pre-post PDC (P = 0.021), as compared with the control group.  CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive medication adherence increased in both reminder  call and control groups, but the increase was significantly higher in the  intervention group. A telephonic outreach program was effective in improving  antihypertensive medication adherence in MAPD beneficiaries.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describe a novel approach to comprehensively summarize medication adherence. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northern California  Diabetes Registry (n approximately 220,000) STUDY DESIGN: In a new prescription  cohort design (27,329 subjects prescribed new medications), we used pharmacy  utilization data to estimate adherence during 24 months follow-up. Proportion of  time without sufficient medications (medication gaps) was estimated using a novel  measure (New Prescription Medication Gaps [NPMG]) and compared with a traditional  measure of adherence. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data derived from  electronic medical records and survey responses. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Twenty-two  percent of patients did not become ongoing users (had zero or only one dispensing  of the new prescription). The proportion of newly prescribed patients that never  became ongoing users was eightfold greater than the proportion who maintained  ongoing use, but with inadequate adherence. Four percent of those with at least  two dispensings discontinued therapy during the 24 months follow-up. NPMG was  significantly associated with high out-of-pocket costs, self-reported adherence,  and clinical response to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: NPMG is a valid adherence measure.  Findings also suggest a larger burden of inadequate adherence than previously  thought. Public health efforts have traditionally focused on improving adherence  in ongoing users; clearly more attention is needed to address nonpersistence in  the very first stages after a new medication is prescribed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical services provided by pharmacists embedded in practices can improve patient outcomes within the primary care setting. Little is known about  whether physician organizations (POs) will retain the services of clinical  pharmacists after outside funding for a statewide implementation program is  ended. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a statewide program, Michigan Pharmacists  Transforming Care and Quality (MPTCQ), that incorporated pharmacists within 17  POs. METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted using data collected from June  2016 to September 2018 from primary care clinical pharmacist encounters in POs  participating in MPTCQ. Process outcomes included the number of participating  POs, patient encounters, and average visits per patient. Analyses at the  encounter level were stratified by 2 encounter types: disease state management  (DSM) or comprehensive medication review (CMR). Separately by encounter type,  pharmacist effect was described by the number, type, and reasons for medication  changes, as well as medication adherence and cost barriers found and addressed.  Clinical outcomes included hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure change.  Sustainability and patient satisfaction of pharmacists providing clinical  services are reported. RESULTS: Across 17 POs, 27 pharmacists participated in the  MPTCQ program. Pharmacists completed 24,523 patient encounters for DSM with 5,942  patients, with an average of 5 visits per patient with diabetes and 2 visits for  hypertension. Pharmacists made 15,153 therapeutic medication changes during  visits for diabetes and hypertension, with approximately 70% related to efficacy.  Pharmacists completed 4,203 CMR visits for 3,092 patients. During CMR visits,  1,296 therapeutic medication changes were recommended. Problems with medication  cost were identified in 13% of CMR visits. Blood pressure and A1c levels  decreased in patients managed by pharmacists. In 157 patients surveyed, 87% rated  their pharmacists' care as excellent. Sixteen POs retained their pharmacists at  the end of funding. CONCLUSIONS: A statewide provider-payer partnership  successfully integrated and retained primary care pharmacists within POs.  Pharmacists in the MPTCQ program contributed to improvements in disease control  by changing medications to improve patient clinical outcomes. DISCLOSURES:  Support for MPTCQ was provided by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM)  as part of the BCBSM Value Partnerships program. Coe was supported by the  National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes  of Health under award number KL2TR002241.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess whether VA MEDIC-E (Veterans Affairs Multi-disciplinary Education and Diabetes Intervention for Cardiac risk reduction[EM DASH] Extended  for 6 months), a pharmacist-led shared medical appointments program, could  improve attainment of target goals for hypertension, hyperglycemia,  hyperlipidemia, and tobacco use in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to  standard primary care after 6 months of intervention. METHODS: A randomized,  controlled trial of VA MEDIC-E (n = 50) versus standard primary care (n = 49) in  veterans with type 2 diabetes, hemoglobin A1c (A1C) > 7%, blood pressure (BP) >  130/80 mmHg, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > 100mg/dl (2.59  mmol/l) in the previous 6 months was conducted. The VA MEDIC-E intervention  consisted of 4 weekly group sessions followed by 5 monthly booster group  sessions. Each 2-hour session included 1 hour of multidisciplinary diabetes  specific healthy lifestyle education and 1 hour of pharmacotherapeutic  interventions performed by a clinical pharmacist. Evaluation measures included  lab values of A1C, LDL cholesterol, BP, and goal attainment of these values, and  diabetes self-care behavior questionnaires at 6 months. RESULTS: The  randomization groups were similar at baseline in all cardiovascular risk factors  except for LDL, which was significantly lower in the MEDIC-E arm. At 6 months,  significant improvements from baseline were found in the intervention arm for  exercise, foot care, and goal attainment of A1C, LDL-C, and BP but not in the  control arm. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the  pharmacist-led group intervention program for 6 months was an efficacious and  sustainable collaborative care approach to managing diabetes and reducing  associated cardiovascular risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several observational studies have evaluated the effect of a single exposure window with blood pressure (BP) medications on outcomes in incident  dialysis patients, but whether BP medication prescription patterns remain stable  or a single exposure window design is adequate to evaluate effect on outcomes is  unclear. METHODS: We described patterns of BP medication prescription over 6  months after dialysis initiation in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis  patients, stratified by cardiovascular comorbidity, diabetes, and other patient  characteristics. The cohort included 13,072 adult patients (12,159 hemodialysis,  913 peritoneal dialysis) who initiated dialysis in Dialysis Clinic, Inc.,  facilities January 1, 2003-June 30, 2008, and remained on the original modality  for at least 6 months. We evaluated monthly patterns in BP medication  prescription over 6 months and at 12 and 24 months after initiation. RESULTS:  Prescription patterns varied by dialysis modality over the first 6 months;  substantial proportions of patients with prescriptions for beta-blockers, renin  angiotensin system agents, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in month  6 no longer had prescriptions for these medications by month 24. Prescription of  specific medication classes varied by comorbidity, race/ethnicity, and age, but  little by sex. The mean number of medications was 2.5 at month 6 in hemodialysis  and peritoneal dialysis cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates BP medication  patterns in both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients over the first 6  months of dialysis. Our findings highlight the challenges of assessing  comparative effectiveness of a single BP medication class in dialysis patients.  Longitudinal designs should be used to account for changes in BP medication  management over time, and designs that incorporate common combinations should be  considered.

AB  - PURPOSE: The impact of pharmacist management of patients with diabetes mellitus enrolled in a rural free clinic was evaluated. METHODS: Data from 95 patients  continuously enrolled in a new pharmacist service were analyzed over 24 months.  Patients were at least 18 years old, qualified for free care on the basis of  income or insurance status, and had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus upon  clinic entry. Under a collaborative agreement, pharmacists educated patients on  diabetes, counseled patients on lifestyle modifications, assessed appropriateness  of drug therapy, and managed drug therapy for diabetes and associated comorbid  conditions. Clinical impact was measured by changes from baseline glycosylated  hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels, blood pressure, and lipid levels over a 24-month  period. Using published cost estimates, the economic impact of the clinic was  calculated based on expected savings for each patient who had a decrease of ≥1%  in HbA(1c) value. RESULTS: Significant reductions from baseline in HbA1c values  (p < 0.0001), systolic blood pressure (p = 0.0011), diastolic blood pressure (p =  0.0015), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.0001), and triglyceride  levels (p = 0.0001) were achieved in clinic patients. Based on an expected  savings of $1,118 per patient who had a decrease of >1% in HbA(1c) value (n =  67), the pharmacist service was estimated to provide a savings of $74,906 per  year. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist management of patients with type 2 diabetes  significantly influenced clinical and economic outcomes in an uninsured  population living in a rural area with few health care resources.

AB  - PURPOSE: Value-based insurance designs (VBID) have been developed by health insurance companies and used by employers to allocate health care resources  appropriately and to lower patients' out-of-pocket costs for services related to  chronic conditions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the  Cincinnati Pharmacy Coaching Program (CPCP) on clinical and economic outcomes.  The CPCP is a VBID implemented by Anthem Blue Cross & Blue Shield in Ohio. It  provided tailored pharmacist-based educational services and financial incentives  to participants. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental pre/post longitudinal  study in which patients were identified as they enrolled in the CPCP between Jan.  1, 2008, and Dec. 31, 2009. Patients could participate in a Diabetes Coaching  Program (DCP) or a Heart Healthy Coaching Program (HHCP). Control subjects were  selected from patients who were invited but did not choose to participate.  Control subjects were matched to intervention cohorts using propensity score  matching. Clinical (blood pressure, lipid levels, and hemoglobin A1c) and  economic (all-cause and disease-attributable) outcomes were evaluated using  within-subject (pre-post) and between-subject comparison (intervention-control)  design. RESULTS: A total of 607 patients were enrolled in intervention groups,  and 557 control subjects were selected after matching. Significant reductions  were found in blood pressure, lipid levels, and hemoglobin A1c after enrollment,  and a significantly greater proportion of patients, compared with controls,  achieved their clinical goals according to national guidelines in both programs.  Hypertension-related cost trends were favorable for HHCP relative to the control  cohort. Diabetes-related costs increased for all groups from pre- to post-index,  largely driven by office visits and medication costs in the DCP and inpatient/ER  visits in the control cohort. CONCLUSION: Results showed significant improvements  in all diabetes- and hypertension-related clinical measures. This study shows the  effect of a comprehensive VBID on the health of patients with chronic disease.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Hypertension is the most common single reason for visits to primary care  physicians accounting for more than 35 million visits annually. Pharmacotherapy  can achieve adequate control of blood pressure. Multiple interventions compares  to single therapies are more efficacious in treating hypertension, and this fact  supports using the holistic approach to hypertension treatment. Implementing an  optimal healing environment (OHE) in a hypertension treatment regimen has the  potential to impact not only health care costs, but also to optimize blood  pressure control, and thus decrease the total cardiovascular disease burden. The  research questions for the study of OHE in hypertension may differ between the  individual patient perspective and the public health perspective. The use of a 2  x 2 factorial design would allow analysis of both perspectives simultaneously.  Using an OHE setting with multiple interventions in formulating an individualized  approach to hypertension management merits further exploration and research.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This qualitative focus group study sought to describe how colleges of pharmacy use simulation-based learning (SBL) to teach cardiovascular topics  and to identify challenges and benefits. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Participants were  recruited from a screening survey disseminated via e-mail to select American  College of Clinical Pharmacy Practice and Research networks. Subjects were  selected based on diversity in institution and simulation types. Two 1-hour focus  group sessions were conducted by the primary investigator following a script  designed by the research team. Each recorded session was independently reviewed  by all investigators and coded into final themes. Results are reported in a  qualitative fashion. RESULTS: Five individuals provided consent and participated.  Themes identified include topics, formats, interprofessional education,  challenges, strategies for success, and benefits. Frequent topics included  advanced cardiac life support, heart failure, hypertension, and transitions of  care. Multiple formats were used including standardized patients or providers,  task trainers, and high-fidelity mannequins. Multiple institutions reported  simulating interprofessional teams by involving students from other health  professions. Scheduling, pharmacy program size, faculty availability, and  logistics around planning and/or conducting an event were identified challenges.  Institutions reported success when clear expectations were provided to students  and skill development progressed from low-stakes to high-stakes events. Benefits  reported included real world applicability with participants noting that students  do not realize the importance of SBL until they have reached rotations.  CONCLUSIONS: Various topics and simulation methods were employed to teach  cardiovascular topics. While challenges exist, institutions have identified  strategies for success and report students recognized the benefits to their  learning.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of integrated care for chronic physical diseases and depression in reducing disability and improving quality of life.  DESIGN: A randomised controlled trial of multi-condition collaborative care for  depression and poorly controlled diabetes and/or risk factors for coronary heart  disease compared with usual care among middle aged and elderly people SETTING:  Fourteen primary care clinics in Seattle, Washington. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with  diabetes or coronary heart disease, or both, and blood pressure above 140/90 mm  Hg, low density lipoprotein concentration >3.37 mmol/L, or glycated haemoglobin  8.5% or higher, and PHQ-9 depression scores of ≥ 10. INTERVENTION: A 12 month  intervention to improve depression, glycaemic control, blood pressure, and lipid  control by integrating a "treat to target" programme for diabetes and risk  factors for coronary heart disease with collaborative care for depression. The  intervention combined self management support, monitoring of disease control, and  pharmacotherapy to control depression, hyperglycaemia, hypertension, and  hyperlipidaemia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Social role disability (Sheehan  disability scale), global quality of life rating, and World Health Organization  disability assessment schedule (WHODAS-2) scales to measure disabilities in  activities of daily living (mobility, self care, household maintenance). RESULTS:  Of 214 patients enrolled (106 intervention and 108 usual care), disability and  quality of life measures were obtained for 97 intervention patients at six months  (92%) and 92 at 12 months (87%), and for 96 usual care patients at six months  (89%) and 92 at 12 months (85%). Improvements from baseline on the Sheehan  disability scale (-0.9, 95% confidence interval -1.5 to -0.2; P = 0.006) and  global quality of life rating (0.7, 0.2 to 1.2; P = 0.005) were significantly  greater at six and 12 months in patients in the intervention group. There was a  trend toward greater improvement in disabilities in activities of daily living  (-1.5, -3.3 to 0.4; P = 0.10). CONCLUSIONS: Integrated care that covers chronic  physical disease and comorbid depression can reduce social role disability and  enhance global quality of life.

TI  - Economic implications with newer agents to reduce cardiovascular risk in diabetes.
AU  - McAdam-Marx, Carrie
T2  - The American journal of managed care
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) plays a significant role in the morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes (T2D). In addition to the negative impact on the  health of patients, people with T2D and CVD encounter higher total healthcare  costs compared with patients with T2D and without CVD. The FDA guidance of 2008  recommending cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) for T2D drug candidates  prompted pharmaceutical companies to conduct such studies. Some of those drug  candidates appear to have beneficial physiologic effects on cardiovascular  outcomes. Pharmacoeconomic analysis can correlate observed improvements to  cardiovascular outcomes to savings in healthcare spending and assist health plans  in assessing the value of diabetes medications. To date, most pharmacoeconomic  studies for antihyperglycemic drugs have been conducted using surrogate markers  of CVD risk (eg, glycated hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, body mass index,  plasma lipid levels) and have established the economic benefit and value of  diabetes drugs based on reduction in cardiovascular events. A few analyses have  been conducted based on CVOT efficacy data and similarly demonstrate value in  patients at high CVD risk. Combined, the pharmacoeconomic data reinforce that  newer agents with CVOT benefit represent good value in general, as well as for  patients with high CVD risk, and support managed care decisions regarding  treatment coverage and recommendations for newer diabetes agents.

T2  - International journal of clinical pharmacy
AB  - BACKGROUND: One way of preventing and solving drug-related problems in frail elderly is to perform team-based medication reviews. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the  quality of the clinical pharmacy service to primary care using structured  medication reviews, focusing on the clinical significance of the recommendations  made by clinical pharmacists. SETTING: A random sample of 150 patients (out of  1541) who received structured team based medication reviews. The patients lived  at a geriatric nursing home or were ≥65 years and lived in ordinary housing with  medication-related community help. METHOD: Based on information on symptoms,  kidney function, blood pressure, diagnoses and the medication list, a pharmacist  identified possible drug-related problems and supplied recommendations for the  general practitioner to act on. Two independent physicians retrospectively ranked  the clinical significance of the recommendations according to Hatoum, with  rankings ranging between 1 (adverse significance) and 6 (extremely significant).  Main outcome measure The clinical significance of the recommendations. Results In  total 349 drug-related problems were identified, leading to recommendations. The  vast majority of the recommendations (96 %) were judged to have significance 3 or  higher and more than the half were judged to have significance 4 or higher.  CONCLUSION: The high proportion of clinically significant recommendations  provided by pharmacists when performing team-based medication reviews suggest  that these clinical pharmacy services have potential to increase prescribing  quality. As such, the medication reviews have the potential for contributing to a  better and safer drug therapy for elderly patients.

AB  - This study examined achievement of blood pressure (BP) goals, changes in antihypertensive therapy and reasons for these changes among adults with  hypertension initiating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs),  angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Claims  data were examined for changes to medication regimens. Patient charts for 501  patients provided BP levels and reasons for changing medications. BP goal  achievement was highest for initiators of ARBs (81.4%), compared with ACEIs  (75.5%; P=NS) and CCBs (68.9%; P<0.01). Changes in antihypertensive therapy were  least likely among ARB recipients (59.9%) compared with ACEIs (71.86%; P=0.02)  and CCBs (74.85%; P<0.01). Failure to achieve BP goals was the most common reason  for change in therapy (ARB, 32.9%; ACEI, 42.5%, P=NS; CCB, 47.9%, P<0.01).  Although most patients achieved target BP goals, many required changes in  treatment regimens. Initial choice of antihypertensive therapy may mitigate  changes in therapies and better achieve BP goals.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Little is known about cross-national comparisons of the persistence of antihypertensive medication treatment, trends in persistence, and factors  associated with persistence. The aim of this study was to describe and compare  patterns of use of antihypertensive drugs in a population of elderly patients in  the United States (Pennsylvania), Canada (British Columbia) and the Netherlands.  METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of Medicare enrollees in a state pharmacy  assistance programme in Pennsylvania (USA), residents from British Columbia  (Canada) and residents from the Netherlands registered in the PHARMO database was  conducted. Each population included patients 65 years and older who were  initiated on blood pressure-lowering treatment between 1 January 1998 and 31  December 2003 and who had continuous follow-up for at least 365 days. In these  populations, the proportion of patients with at least 180 consecutive days  without medication available (non-persistence) were identified as were predictors  of non-persistence using Cox proportional hazards. RESULTS: A total of 9664  Medicare enrollees (USA), 25 377 residents from British Columbia and 24 603  residents from the Netherlands were evaluated. During the first year after the  initiation of treatment, the percentage of patients with at least 180 days  without medication was 23.3% in Pennsylvania, 23.4% in British Columbia and 24.0%  in the Netherlands. After 6 years, these percentages increased to 41.1, 36.3 and  38.2%, respectively. Factors associated with non-persistence were different  between the three countries. CONCLUSION: Despite differences in factors  associated with persistence, non-persistence patterns are strikingly similar in  all three populations. This suggests that the problem of non-persistence  transcends international boundaries.

AB  - Value-based insurance design (VBID) plans selectively lower cost sharing to increase medication adherence. Existing plans have been structured in a variety  of ways, and these variations could influence the effectiveness of VBID plans. We  evaluated seventy-six plans introduced by a large pharmacy benefit manager during  2007-10. We found that after we adjusted for the other features and baseline  trends, VBID plans that were more generous, targeted high-risk patients, offered  wellness programs, did not offer disease management programs, and made the  benefit available only for medication ordered by mail had a significantly greater  impact on adherence than plans without these features. The effects were as large  as 4-5 percentage points. These findings can provide guidance for the structure  of future VBID plans.

T2  - Contemporary clinical trials
AB  - In the U.S., more than 400,000 individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) require hemodialysis (HD) for renal replacement therapy. ESRD patients experience  a high burden of morbidity, mortality, resource utilization, and poor quality of  life (QOL). Under current care models, ESRD patients receive fragmented care from  multiple providers at multiple locations. The Patient-Centered Medical Home  (PCMH) is a team approach, providing coordinated care across the healthcare  continuum. While this model has shown some early benefits for complex chronic  diseases such as diabetes, it has not been applied to HD patients. This study is  a non-randomized quasi-experimental intervention trial implementing a  Patient-Centered Medical Home for Kidney Disease (PCMH-KD). The PCMH-KD extends  the existing dialysis care team (comprised of a nephrologist, dialysis nurse,  dialysis technician, social worker, and dietitian) by adding a general internist,  pharmacist, nurse coordinator, and a community health worker, all of whom will  see the patients together, and separately, as needed. The primary goal is to  implement a comprehensive, multidisciplinary care team to improve care  coordination, quality of life, and healthcare use for HD patients. Approximately  240 patients will be recruited from two sites; a non-profit university-affiliated  dialysis center and an independent for-profit dialysis center. Outcomes include  (i) patient-reported outcomes, including QOL and satisfaction; (ii) clinical  outcomes, including blood pressure and diet; (iii) healthcare use, including  emergency room visits and hospitalizations; and (iv) staff perceptions. Given the  significant burden that patients with ESRD on HD experience, enhanced care  coordination provides an opportunity to reduce this burden and improve QOL.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The effectiveness and costs associated with addition of pharmacist-led group medical visits to standard care for patients with Type-2  Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is unknown. METHODS: Randomized-controlled-trial in  three US Veteran Health Administration (VHA) Hospitals, where 250 patients with  T2DM, HbA1c >7% and either hypertension, active smoking or hyperlipidemia were  randomized to either (1) addition of pharmacist-led group-medical-visits or (2)  standard care alone for 13 months. Group (4-6 patients) visits consisted of  2-hour, education and comprehensive medication management sessions once weekly  for 4 weeks, followed by quarterly visits. Change from baseline in cardiovascular  risk estimated by the UKPDS-risk-score, health-related quality-of-life (SF36v)  and institutional healthcare costs were compared between study arms. RESULTS:  After 13 months, both groups had similar and significant improvements from  baseline in UKPDS-risk-score (-0.02 ±0.09 and -0.04 ±0.09, group visit and  standard care respectively, adjusted p<0.05 for both); however, there was no  significant difference between the study arms (adjusted p = 0.45). There were no  significant differences on improvement from baseline in A1c,  systolic-blood-pressure, and LDL as well as health-related quality-of-life  measures between the study arms. Compared to 13 months prior, the increase in  per-person outpatient expenditure from baseline was significantly lower in the  group visit versus the standard care arm, both during the study intervention  period and at 13-months after study interventions. The overall VHA healthcare  costs/person were comparable between the study arms during the study period (p =  0.15); then decreased by 6% for the group visit but increased by 13% for the  standard care arm 13 months post-study (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Addition of  pharmacist-led group medical visits in T2DM achieved similar improvements from  baseline in cardiovascular risk factors than usual care, but with reduction in  the healthcare costs in the group visit arm 13 months after completion compared  to the steady rise in cost for the usual care arm.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI) is the second leading cause of death from blunt trauma. In the present study, we aimed to determine the outcomes  of medical management (MM) for BTAI. We hypothesized from the results of several  previously reported studies, that patients with a minimal aortic injury (BTAI  grades 1 and 2) could safely be treated with definitive MM alone. METHODS: The  Aortic Trauma Foundation international prospective multicenter registry was used  to examine the demographics, injury characteristics, management, and outcomes of  patients with BTAI. We analyzed a subset of patients for whom MM was initiated as  definitive therapy. RESULTS: From November 2016 to April 2020, 432 patients  (median age, 41 years; 76% male; median injury severity score, 34) with BTAI  (Society for Vascular Surgery grade 1, 23.6%; grade 2, 14.4%; grade 3, 51.2%;  grade 4, 10.9%) were evaluated. Of the 432 patients, 245 (57%) had received MM in  the initial period and 114 (26.4%) had received MM as the planned definitive  therapy (grade 1, 59.6%; grade 2, 23.7%; grade 3, 15.8%; grade 4, 0.9%). The most  common mechanism of BTAI was a motor vehicle collision (60.4%). Hypotension was  present on arrival in 74 patients (17.2%). Continuous titratable infusion of  antihypertensive medication was used for 49.1%, followed by intermittent bolus  administration (29.8%), with beta-blockers (74.6%) the most common agent used.  Treatments were targeted to a goal systolic blood pressure for 83.3%, most often  to a target goal systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg (66.3%). The MM goals based  on blood pressure control were attained in 64.0% (73 of 114). Twelve patients  (10.5%; grade 1, 1; grade 2, 0; grade 3, 10; grade 4, 1) had required subsequent  intervention after MM. Eleven patients (9.6%) had undergone thoracic endovascular  aortic repair and one (0.9%) had required open repair for a grade 4 injury. The  overall in-hospital mortality for patients selected for definitive MM was 7.9%.  No aortic-related deaths had occurred in the patients receiving definitive MM.  CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one in four patients with BTAI will receive MM as  definitive therapy. The variation in the pharmacologic therapies used is  considerable. MM for patients with minimal aortic injury (BTAI grades 1 and 2) is  safe and effective, with a low overall intervention rate and no aortic-related  deaths. These findings support the use of definitive MM for grade 2 BTAI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many studies have identified patient characteristics or chronic diseases associated with medication adherence, the clinical utility of  such predictors has rarely been assessed. We attempted to develop clinical  prediction rules for adherence with antihypertensive medications in 2 healthcare  delivery systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed retrospective cohort studies  of hypertension registries in an inner-city healthcare delivery system (n=17 176)  and a health maintenance organization (n=94 297) in Denver, Colo. Adherence was  defined by acquisition of 80% or more of antihypertensive medications. A  multivariable model in the inner-city system found that adherent patients (36.3%  of the total) were more likely than nonadherent patients to be older, white,  married, and acculturated in US society, to have diabetes or cerebrovascular  disease, not to abuse alcohol or controlled substances, and to be prescribed  fewer than 3 antihypertensive medications. Although statistically significant,  all multivariate odds ratios were 1.7 or less, and the model did not accurately  discriminate adherent from nonadherent patients (C statistic=0.606). In the  health maintenance organization, where 72.1% of patients were adherent,  significant but weak associations existed between adherence and older age, white  race, the lack of alcohol abuse, and fewer antihypertensive medications. The  multivariate model again failed to accurately discriminate adherent from  nonadherent individuals (C statistic=0.576). CONCLUSIONS: Although certain  sociodemographic characteristics or clinical diagnoses are statistically  associated with adherence to refills of antihypertensive medications, a  combination of these characteristics is not sufficiently accurate to allow  clinicians to predict whether their patients will be adherent with treatment.

T2  - Preventing chronic disease
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Mississippi Delta has high rates of chronic disease and is known for its poor health outcomes and health disparities. The University of  Mississippi School of Pharmacy (UMSOP) and the Mississippi State Department of  Health partnered in 2009 through the Mississippi Delta Health Collaborative to  reduce health disparities and improve clinical outcomes by expanding the UMSOP's  evidence-based medication therapy management (MTM) initiative, focused in  Mississippi's 18-county Delta region, to federally qualified health centers  (FQHCs) in 4 of those counties. METHODS: Between January 2009 and August 2018,  the MTM initiative targeted FQHC patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis  of diabetes, hypertension, and/or dyslipidemia. Pharmacists initially met  face-to-face with patients to review all medications, provide education about  chronic diseases, identify and resolve drug therapy problems, and take  appropriate actions to help improve the effectiveness of medication therapies.  Clinical parameters evaluated were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood  pressure (DBP), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,  triglycerides, and hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)). RESULTS: The analysis included 335  patients with hypertension (n = 287), dyslipidemia (n = 131), and/or diabetes (n  = 331). Significant mean reductions occurred in the following metrics: SBP (7.1  mm Hg), DBP (6.3 mm Hg), LDL cholesterol (24.9 mg/dL), triglycerides (45.5  mg/dL), total cholesterol (37.7 mg/dL), and HbA(1c) (1.6% [baseline ≥6%] and 1.9%  [baseline ≥9%]). CONCLUSION: Despite the cultural and environmental disadvantages  present in the Mississippi Delta, the integrated MTM treatment program  demonstrated significant health improvements across 3 chronic diseases:  hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. This model demonstrates that a  partnership between public health and pharmacy is a successful and innovative  approach to care.

T2  - Diabetes care
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that level of glycemic control is related to medical care costs in adults with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:  Regression analysis was used to estimate the relationship between glycemic  control and medical care charges for 3,017 adults with diabetes who were  continuously enrolled in a large health maintenance organization (HMO) over a  4-year period. Diagnosis of diabetes was ascertained from diagnostic and  pharmaceutical databases using a method with an estimated sensitivity of 0.91 and  an estimated specificity of 0.99. Charges for care included defined outpatient  and inpatient services. Patients who disenrolled or who died during the 4-year  period were excluded from the main analysis. RESULTS: Charges for medical care  for patients with diabetes from 1993 to 1995 were closely related to HbA1c level  in 1992 before and after adjustment for age, sex, coronary heart disease, and  hypertension. Standardized 3-year estimates of charges ranged from $10,439 for  patients without comorbid conditions to $44,417 for those with heart disease and  hypertension. Medical care charges increased significantly for every 1% increase  above HbA1c of 7%. For a person with an HbA1c value of 6%, successive 1%  increases in HbA1c resulted in cumulative increases in charges of approximately  4, 10, 20, and 30%. The increase in charges accelerated as the HbA1c value  increased. For patients with diabetes only, or with diabetes plus other chronic  conditions, the rate of increase in charges with HbA1c was consistent.  CONCLUSIONS: HbA1c provides useful information to providers and patients  regarding both health status and future medical care charges. Economic data  suggest that clinicians should assign high importance to low HbA1c results and  aggressively maintain the HbA1c status of patients who have low HbA1c values. For  economic as well as clinical reasons, it may be beneficial to lower HbA1c when it  is > 8% and to reduce cardiovascular risk factors. The medical charge data  suggest that investment in clinical systems to improve diabetes care may benefit  both payers and patients.

AU  - Dubois, Robert W.

T2  - Disease management : DM
AB  - Previous studies have shown that the primary factor underlying increased spending on pharmaceuticals has been the rising utilization of medications, rather than  increases in unit drug price. This study examined the evolution of clinical  practice guidelines to assess possible reasons for the rising drug volume.  Clinical practice guidelines from 1970 to the present were reviewed for the six  most prevalent treatable medical conditions/risk factors listed as priority areas  by the Institute of Medicine. We searched the National Guidelines Clearinghouse,  PubMed and Medline databases, and Web sites of relevant national organizations  for US clinical practice guidelines published through January 2005. Information  pertaining to the therapeutic regimen (eg, the frequency and duration of  recommended treatment, when treatment should be initiated, the patient population  for whom the guideline was intended) was abstracted and entered into evidence  tables. Changes in guidelines were distributed across three themes that  recommended evidence-based increases in medication use, including: (1) changes in  the size of the treatable population; (2) changes in the number and type of  recommended pharmaceutical therapeutic options, including movement from  monotherapy to combination therapy, treatment of comorbidities, and use of newer  types of medicines; and (3) changes in the therapeutic regimen, including a shift  from episodic care to preventive and chronic care. Many of these changes point to  an important, but not often noticed, addition of secondary prevention of disease  effects to the objectives of medical care. These trends are likely to continue  with important economic, clinical, and policy ramifications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine which of 3 interventions was most effective in improving blood pressure (BP) control, we performed a 4-arm randomized trial with 18-month  follow-up at the primary care clinics at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center.  METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized to either usual care or 1 of 3  telephone-based intervention groups: (1) nurse-administered behavioral  management, (2) nurse- and physician-administered medication management, or (3) a  combination of both. Of the 1551 eligible patients, 593 individuals were  randomized; 48% were African American. The intervention telephone calls were  triggered based on home BP values transmitted via telemonitoring devices.  Behavioral management involved promotion of health behaviors. Medication  management involved adjustment of medications by a study physician and nurse  based on hypertension treatment guidelines. RESULTS: The primary outcome was  change in BP control measured at 6-month intervals over 18 months. Both the  behavioral management and medication management alone showed significant  improvements at 12 months-12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6%-24.1%) and  12.5% (95% CI, 1.3%-23.6%), respectively-but not at 18 months. In subgroup  analyses, among those with poor baseline BP control, systolic BP decreased in the  combined intervention group by 14.8 mm Hg (95% CI, -21.8 to -7.8 mm Hg) at 12  months and 8.0 mm Hg (95% CI, -15.5 to -0.5 mm Hg) at 18 months, relative to  usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Overall intervention effects were moderate, but among  individuals with poor BP control at baseline, the effects were larger. This study  indicates the importance of identifying individuals most likely to benefit from  potentially resource intensive programs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov  Identifier: NCT00237692.

T2  - Journal of clinical hypertension (Greenwich, Conn.)
AB  - Physician-pharmacist collaborative care (PPCC) is effective in improving blood pressure (BP) control, but primary care provider (PCP) engagement in such models  has not been well-studied. The authors analyzed data from PPCC referrals to 108  PCPs, for patients with uncontrolled hypertension, assessing the proportion of  referral requests approved, disapproved, and not responded to, and reasons for  disapproval. Of 2232 persons with uncontrolled hypertension, PPCC referral  requests were sent for 1516 (67.9%): 950 (62.7%) were approved, 406 (26.8%) were  disapproved, and 160 (10.6%) received no response. Approval rates differed widely  by PCP with a median approval rate of 75% (interquartile range, 41%-100%). The  most common reasons for disapproval were: PCP prefers to manage hypertension  (19%), and BP controlled per PCP (18%); 8% of cases were considered too complex  for PPCC. Provider acceptance of a PPCC hypertension clinic was generally high  and sustained but varied widely among PCPs. No single reason for disapproval  predominated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since irrational use of antihypertensives has considerable clinical and economical consequences, this study was conducted to evaluate  antihypertensive drug utilization in hypertension at seven State Health Centres  in Istanbul. METHOD: A total of 297 hypertensive patients who accepted to  participate in the study were evaluated by a face-to-face questionnaire and a  copy of their prescriptions were collected for prescription analysis. RESULTS:  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (31.7%), calcium channel blockers  (28.8%), diuretics (16.2%), beta blockers (7.5%) and others (15.8%) have been  prescribed. There were no statistically significant relation between prescribed  antihypertensive drug groups and gender, age, and NSAIDs co-prescribing. The most  frequent comorbidity in hypertensive patients was diabetes mellitus (10.4%) and  calcium channel blockers (35.5%) have been prescribed to them as a first  antihypertensive medication. Average cost per prescription was $42.7 +/- 38.1.  According to the patients' self-reporting, the majority of them (85%) were  prescribed without a physical examination. The physicians failed to write the  prescriptions appropriately; only 5% of the scripts contained all information  about the drug(s) and use instructions in full format. CONCLUSION: The present  study indicates that GPs working at primary healthcare centres were rational in  terms of antihypertensive drug choice. However, they poorly applied rational  pharmacotherapy principles such as (a) writing a "good" prescription which is  easily readable by the pharmacist and the patient and that contains full  essential information; (b) a medical examination of the patient to assess her/his  current clinical condition; and (c) taking care of not prescribing drugs with  potential interaction like antihypertensives and NSAIDs together.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes attained by the DiabetesCARE component of the PharmacistCARE program, which is an innovative pharmacy practice model  implemented within a self-insured employer. DESIGN: Descriptive nonexperimental  study. SETTING: University of Kentucky (UK), from March 2003 through December  2006. PATIENTS: 236 patients with diabetes (95% with type 2 diabetes).  INTERVENTION: Three clinical pharmacists provided UK Health Plan (UKHP) members  with diabetes with comprehensive disease state and medication therapy management.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical outcomes included glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C),  fasting lipid panels, blood pressure, weight, vaccination rates, and aspirin use.  Humanistic outcomes included the mental and physical components of the 12-Item  Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) and patient satisfaction with health services  related to their diabetes care. Screening parameters included the proportion of  patients meeting Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set expectations  for patients with diabetes. Productivity and health resource use were also  assessed based on patient responses to survey questions. RESULTS: After 1 year of  enrollment, patients in the DiabetesCARE program achieved improved clinical  outcomes compared with baseline, as evidenced by statistically significant  reductions in A1C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and total  cholesterol. Statistically significant increases were seen in high-density  lipoprotein cholesterol and the proportion of patients obtaining influenza  vaccine, yearly screenings for lipid level assessment, screenings for kidney  disease, and eye examinations. The mental component score of the SF-12 was  significantly increased. Patients were highly satisfied with the DiabetesCARE  service, and satisfaction with their overall diabetes care within UKHP was  significantly enhanced. Based on the patient provided survey data analyzed here,  productivity and health resource use were unchanged; however, additional analyses  using UKHP claims data are ongoing. CONCLUSION: The DiabetesCARE program is a  unique pharmacist-provided service delivered in a freestanding pharmacist clinic  that enhances health outcomes for adult members with diabetes in a self-insured  employer group.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Blood pressure control among patients with hypertension is a widely recognized quality metric, but many large health systems fail to reach targets  set by the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set. We developed an  interactive voice response (IVR) system called the "Mobile You Blood Pressure  Program" at a large academic medical center and linked it to the health system's  electronic health record (EHR). The goal of the program was to capture home blood  pressure readings in the EHR and to alert ambulatory care clinical pharmacists  automatically of readings below or above clinical thresholds through direct  messaging in the EHR. The goal of this report is to describe implementation of  IVR, initial patient participation rates, and pharmacist-identified barriers to  patient enrollment. SETTING: Ambulatory care clinical pharmacist specialists'  practice in 14 clinics in family medicine and internal medicine at Michigan  Medicine, an academic health system serving more than 24,000 patients with a  diagnosis of hypertension. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: This study describes  implementation and initial patient enrollment in IVR linked to the EHR for home  blood pressure monitoring. EVALUATION: We tracked the number of hypertensive  patients enrolled and IVR call completion rates between September 2017 and  February 2018. We also assessed pharmacist-identified barriers to patient  enrollment during 2 separate 2-week intervals in January and February 2018.  RESULTS: Between September 1, 2017, and February 28, 2018, a total of 71 patients  were enrolled from 14 clinics. Patients were scheduled for 1-3 IVR calls per week  focusing on medication adherence and blood pressure control. A total of 936 IVR  phone calls were made, with 488 (52%) calls completed. Access to a validated home  blood pressure monitor was the largest pharmacist-identified barrier to patient  enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: The IVR Mobile You Blood Pressure Program represents a  new application of digital technology within our health system.  Pharmacist-identified barriers to patient participation included access to a  validated home blood pressure monitor.

TI  - A Multichannel Medication Adherence Intervention Influences Patient and Prescriber Behavior.
AU  - Leslie, R. Scott

T2  - Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare Health Plan Quality and Performance Ratings program, or Star Ratings program, includes 3  medication adherence outcome measures (Medication Adherence for Diabetes  Medications, Medication Adherence for Hypertension, and Medication Adherence for  Cholesterol), which contribute to approximately 31% of a Medicare Advantage  prescription drug (MA-PD) plan's Part D summary rating and 12% of its overall  star rating (a weighted summary of a plan's Part C and Part D ratings). MA-PD  plans have been increasing their adherence intervention efforts as an approach to  improving beneficiaries' medication adherence and the plan's quality performance  ratings. However, few evaluations have examined the effects of these  interventions on medication adherence and performance ratings. OBJECTIVE: To  assess the impact of a quasi-experimental multichannel adherence intervention on  beneficiaries' medication adherence and health plan quality performance measures  for 2 MA-PD plans. The intervention included a daily prescriber-directed 90-day  retail refill component and a weekly member-directed refill reminder component.  METHODS: Members filling 1 or more medications assessed by the 3 CMS star ratings  adherence measures (oral antidiabetics [DM], antihypertensives [HTN], and statins  [CHOL]) were identified for a 2-component intervention starting in April 2013.  The retail-based 90-day refill component sent populated 90-day prescription  letters via fax to prescribers of members who had filled a 30-day prescription.  One fax per member-medication instance was sent and included the option to fax  approval of a new 90-day prescription. For prescribers who approved, members were  notified that a 90-day refill was available at their retail pharmacies. The  refill reminder component used weekly scans of pharmacy claims to identify  members' refill patterns. Reminder letters were sent to members 7 days late to  refill. An intent-to-treat approach was used to assess intervention  effectiveness. Pharmacy claims and health plan enrollment data were used to  calculate adherence among members enrolled 1 year pre- and postintervention start  (April 2013) for the intervention group and a comparator group that consisted of  4 MA-PD plans not implementing an adherence intervention. Adherence was estimated  by the proportion of days covered (PDC) and generalized linear models were fit to  calculate difference-in-difference (DID) estimators to control for demographics,  comorbidity, and changes in adherence over the study period. To estimate the  impact of the intervention on health plan quality performance, 2013 and 2014 CMS  star ratings for the respective 2012 and 2013 measurement years were compared by  group. RESULTS: During the first year of the intervention, 1,344 prescribers  representing 6,701 members were faxed 15,284 populated prescription letters.  Prescriber response rate was 53.7% and approval rate (approved letters of total  sent) was 47.3%. An average of 539 refill reminder letters were sent per week.  DID estimators showed positive influence of the intervention on adherence to HTN  and CHOL. For the intervention group, adherence increased 2.0 percentage points  (P < 0.001) for HTN and 1.8 percentage points (P < 0.001) for CHOL, relative to  the control group. The odds of achieving adherence (PDC ≥ 80%) were greater in  the intervention group compared with control for HTN (ratio of odds ratio [ROR] =  1.334; 95% CI = 1.203-1.479) and for CHOL (ROR = 1.247; 95% CI = 1.132-1.374).  For the 2 plans implementing the intervention, CMS-published adherence rates for  DM, HTN, and CHOL increased from 2012 to 2013 by an average 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0  percentage points, respectively, compared with the control group (3.5, 2.0, and  1.8 percentage points, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study found increases in  adherence to HTN and CHOL in 2 MA-PD plans implementing a combined prescriber and  patient-directed intervention. MA-PD plans can use broad multichannel  interventions to address common adherence barriers and as an approach to  improving members' adherence to maintenance medications and CMS quality  performance ratings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) reported that intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment reduced cardiovascular disease and  mortality compared to standard BP treatment in hypertension patients. The next  important question is how to implement more intensive BP treatment in real-world  clinical practice. We designed an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial to  simultaneously test the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention for  intensive BP treatment and its feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability in  underserved hypertension patients. METHODS: Implementation of Multifaceted  Patient-Centered Treatment Strategies for Intensive Blood Pressure Control  (IMPACTS) is a cluster randomized trial conducted in 36 Federally Qualified  Health Center clinics in Louisiana and Mississippi. Federally Qualified Health  Center clinics were randomized to either a multifaceted intervention for  intensive BP treatment, including protocol-based treatment using the SPRINT  intensive BP management algorithm, dissemination of SPRINT findings, BP audit and  feedback, home BP monitoring, and health coaching, or enhanced usual care.  Difference in mean systolic BP change from baseline to 18 months is the primary  clinical effectiveness outcome, and intervention fidelity, measured by treatment  intensification and medication adherence, is the primary implementation outcome.  The planned sample size of 1,260 participants (36 clinics with 35 participants  each) has 90% power to detect a 5.0-mm Hg difference in systolic BP at a .05  significance level and 80% follow-up rate. CONCLUSIONS: IMPACTS will generate  critical data on the effectiveness and implementation of a multifaceted  intervention for intensive BP treatment in real-world clinical practice and could  directly impact the BP-related disease burden in minority and low-income  populations in the United States.

AB  - Despite the importance of antihypertensive medication therapy for blood pressure control, no single data system provides estimates of medication nonadherence  rates across age groups and health insurance plans types. Using multiple  administrative datasets and national survey data, we determined health insurance  plan-specific and overall weighted national rates of nonadherence to  antihypertensive medications among insured hypertensive US adults in 2015. We  used 2015 prescription claims data from Medicare Part D and 3 IBM MarketScan  databases (Commercial, Medicaid, Medicare Supplemental) to calculate medication  nonadherence rates among hypertensive adults aged ≥18 years with public or  private health insurance using the proportion of days covered algorithm. These  findings, in combination with National Health Interview Survey findings, were  used to project national weighted estimates of nonadherence. We included 23.8  million hypertensive adults who filled 265.8 million prescriptions for  antihypertensive medications. Nonadherence differed by health insurance plan type  (highest for Medicaid members, 55.4%; lowest for Medicare Part D members, 25.2%).  The overall weighted national nonadherence rate was 31.0%, with greater  nonadherence among women versus men, younger versus older adults (aged 18-34  years, 58.1%; aged 65-74 years, 24.4%), fixed-dose combination medication  nonusers (31.2%) versus users (29.4%), and by pharmacy outlet type (retail only,  30.7%; any mail order, 19.8%). In 2015, almost one-third (≈16.3 million) of  insured US adults with diagnosed hypertension were considered nonadherent to  their antihypertensive medication regimen, and considerable disparities were  evident. Public health and healthcare professionals can use available  evidence-based interventions to address nonadherence and improve blood pressure  control.

T2  - Metabolic syndrome and related disorders
AB  - Background: Sacubitril/valsartan was approved for New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in 2015,  based on the results of the PARADIGM-HF trial, which showed a reduction in  cardiovascular (CV) death and heart failure hospitalization, compared with  enalapril. A subsequent subgroup analysis of the trial showed glycemic  improvement for patients on sacubitril/valsartan compared with those on  enalapril. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study at the Loma  Linda University (LLU) International Heart Institute (IHI). The aim was to  evaluate the association of sacubitril/valsartan with glycemic index and other  metabolic parameters, including change in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), blood pressure  (BP), ejection fraction (EF), body weight, and lipid profile from baseline and at  3, 6, and 12 months. The rates of CV-related hospitalizations and total  hospitalizations were also assessed. Results: The change in mean HbA1C from  baseline was not significantly different at 1 year (P = 0.993). The mean EF was  significantly higher and the mean diastolic BP was significantly lowered. Body  weight and lipid parameters remained unchanged. Both the rates of CV-related  hospitalizations and total hospitalizations were significantly lowered. For the  prespecified subgroup analysis of diabetic HFrEF patients, the mean HbA1C was  nonsignificant at 12 months (mean difference -0.48, P = 0.993). Conclusion: A  non-significant reduction in HbA1C was associated in HFrEF patients with diabetes  mellitus. Large randomized trials are needed to confirm our findings regarding  the potential metabolic benefits of sacubitril/valsartan.

T2  - The American journal of managed care
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare rates of discontinuation of prescription therapy for hypertension in Medicaid patients with and without medication access  restrictions. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Prescription  data were extracted from a pharmacy claims database in a large state that  implemented a Medicaid preferred drug list (PDL), both before and after the PDL  was implemented. Prescriptions filled between June 2000 and May 2003 were  included. RESULTS: Medicaid patients taking prescription medications commonly  used to treat hypertension were 39% (odds ratio = 1.39; 95% confidence interval,  1.21, 1.6) more likely to discontinue hypertension therapy after the restriction  was implemented compared with Medicaid patients 1 year earlier when there were no  restrictions. Patients were classified as "discontinued" if they had therapy  available less than 50% of the time during the 12 months after implementation of  the PDL. Before the PDL, 17% of patients receiving treatment with hypertension  medication discontinued therapy. After the PDL, 21% of Medicaid patients taking  hypertension medication discontinued therapy. After the PDL, Medicaid patients  were significantly more likely to switch medications from a restricted to an  unrestricted drug. Those patients also were less likely to have a restricted drug  added to their therapy regimen. CONCLUSIONS: After implementation of the PDL,  Medicaid patients were more likely to discontinue filling prescriptions for  antihypertensive medication. Because hypertension management is an important  challenge within the Medicaid community, the potential connection between access  restrictions and patient adherence to medication therapy is a worthy topic for  further exploratory studies and quantitative outcomes research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: African Americans are significantly more likely than whites to have uncontrolled hypertension, contributing to significant disparities in  cardiovascular disease and events. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to  examine whether there were differences in change in blood pressure (BP) for  African American and non-Hispanic white patients in response to a medication  management and tailored nurse-delivered telephone behavioral program.  PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred and seventy-three patients (284 African American and  289 non-Hispanic white) primary care patients who participated in the  Hypertension Intervention Nurse Telemedicine Study (HINTS) clinical trial.  INTERVENTIONS: Study arms included: 1) nurse-administered, physician-directed  medication management intervention, utilizing a validated clinical decision  support system; 2) nurse-administered, behavioral management intervention; 3)  combined behavioral management and medication management intervention; and 4)  usual care. All interventions were activated based on poorly controlled home BP  values. MAIN MEASURES: Post-hoc analysis of change in systolic and diastolic  blood pressure. General linear models (PROC MIXED in SAS, version 9.2) were used  to estimate predicted means at 6-month, 12-month, and 18-month time points, by  intervention arm and race subgroups (separate models for systolic and diastolic  blood pressure). KEY RESULTS: Improvement in mean systolic blood pressure  post-baseline was greater for African American patients in the combined  intervention, compared to African American patients in usual care, at 12 months  (6.6 mmHg; 95 % CI: -12.5, -0.7; p=0.03) and at 18 months (9.7 mmHg; -16.0, -3.4;  p=0.003). At 18 months, mean diastolic BP was 4.8 mmHg lower (95 % CI: -8.5,  -1.0; p=0.01) among African American patients in the combined intervention arm,  compared to African American patients in usual care. There were no analogous  differences for non-Hispanic white patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of home  BP monitoring, remote medication management, and telephone tailored behavioral  self-management appears to be particularly effective for improving BP among  African Americans. The effect was not seen among non-Hispanic white patients.

T2  - Journal of the American Medical Directors Association
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe antihypertensive medication use, determine what effects comorbid illness has on prescribing of  commonly used antihypertensive medications, and explore how treatment affected  selected clinical and functional outcomes in US nursing home residents. DESIGN:  Cross-sectional observational study using data from the 2004 National Nursing  Home Survey, a nationally representative sample of US nursing home residents.  RESULTS: More than one half, 53.8%, of all residents had hypertension as a  primary admission or current diagnosis. A large majority (84%) of residents with  the diagnosis of hypertension were receiving at least one legend medication  indicated for hypertension. The most common selection of pharmacologic agent was  monotherapy with diuretics in 11% of all residents receiving antihypertensive  medications. Hypertensive residents with a diagnosis of arrhythmia (odds ratio  [OR] = 1.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02-1.38), stroke (OR = 1.18, 95% CI  = 1.05-1.34), or heart failure (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.04-1.32) were more likely  to be receiving a beta blocker. Those with diabetes (OR = 0.86, 95% CI =  0.77-0.96), depression (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.70-0.87), constipation (OR = 0.72,  95% CI = 0.61-0.84), or asthma (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.34-0.74) were less likely  to be receiving a beta blocker. Hospital admission was less likely (OR = 0.50,  95% CI = 0.36-0.69) when residents were taking any commonly used antihypertensive  medication (diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme/angiotensin  receptor blockers [ACE/ARBs], calcium channel blockers, or alpha-blockers) but  significantly more likely when therapy included a beta blocker (OR = 1.45, 95% CI  = 1.18 - 1.78). Beta blockers were associated with an increased likelihood of  falls (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.04-1.27) and a decreased likelihood of constipation  (OR 0.72, 95% CI = 0.61-0.84). Beta blockers were associated with a decreased  likelihood of depression (OR 0.83, 95% CI = 0.74-0.92) as was the use of any  commonly used antihypertensive (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.63-0.90). CONCLUSION:  Hypertension is prevalent in US nursing home residents and most residents with  that diagnosis (84%) are being treated with antihypertensive medication. Through  examination of the National Nursing Home Survey database, associations between  the use of selected antihypertensive medication, comorbid illness, and specified  outcomes were observed.

AB  - This study compared drug coverage and prescription drug use by race and Hispanic ethnicity for Medicare beneficiaries with three chronic conditions: diabetes,  hypertension, or heart disease. We found that among beneficiaries without any  drug coverage black persons and Hispanics used 10 to 40 percent fewer  medications, on average, than white persons with the same illness, and spent up  to 60 percent less in total drug costs. Having drug coverage somewhat lessened  these differences although the effect was consistent with only M + C prescription  benefits. Substantially lower medication use remained for dually eligible black  beneficiaries and Hispanics with employer-sponsored drug benefits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interindividual variability in blood pressure (BP) response to antihypertensives has been reported. Although plasma renin activity (PRA) is a  potential biomarker for personalizing antihypertensive therapy in European  American (EA) and African American (AA) hypertensives, clinical utility of  PRA-guided prescribing is incompletely understood. METHODS: Using  systematic-phased approach, PRA's clinical utility was assessed. After  categorizing by baseline PRA, clinic systolic BP (SBP) responses to metoprolol  and chlorthalidone were compared in 134 EAs and 102 AAs enrolled in the  Pharmacogenomics Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses-2 (PEAR-2) trial.  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted in EAs. Data from  PEAR-2 AAs were used to estimate an optimal PRA cut point using multivariable  linear regression models. The derived cut point in AAs was tested in a  meta-analysis of 2 independent AA cohorts, and its sensitivity and specificity  were assessed. RESULTS: EAs with PRA < 0.65 ng/ml/hour had a greater decrease in  SBP to chlorthalidone than metoprolol (by -15.9 mm Hg, adjusted P < 0.0001),  whereas those with PRA ≥ 0.65 ng/ml/hour had a greater decrease in SBP to  metoprolol than chlorthalidone (by 3.3 mm Hg, adjusted P = 0.04). Area under ROC  curve (0.69, P = 0.0001) showed that PRA can predict SBP response among EAs.  However, we observed no association between PRA and SBP response in PEAR-2 AAs.  Among independent AA cohorts, those with PRA ≥ 1.3 ng/ml/hour (PEAR-2-derived cut  point) responded better to atenolol/candesartan than hydrochlorothiazide  (meta-analysis P = 0.01). However, sensitivity of the derived cut point was 10%.  CONCLUSIONS: PRA at the previously established 0.60-0.65 ng/ml/hour cut point is  an effective predictive biomarker of BP response in EAs. However, we were unable  to identify PRA cut point that could be used to guide antihypertensive selection  in AAs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01203852, NCT00246519, NCT00005520.

T2  - The Journal of family practice
AB  - PURPOSE: Despite numerous studies on adherence, there is little research on the first-fill rate of antihypertensive prescriptions. Our study took advantage of  the recent increase in electronic prescribing (e-prescribing) and used data from  e-prescribing physicians to determine the first-fill failure rate of  antihypertensive prescriptions and to assess which factors predict first-fill  failure. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed claims from a Mid-Atlantic  managed care organization (MCO). We included adult members with continuous  medical and pharmacy coverage who were prescribed an antihypertensive in 2008 by  an e-prescribing physician. First-fill failure occurred when the patient did not  obtain the antihypertensive medication due to either a denial by the MCO or  reversal by the dispensing pharmacist. (Pharmacists reverse claims when a patient  fails to pick up a medication.) Multivariate regression analysis determined the  clinical and demographic factors associated with failure to fill. RESULTS: The  cohort consisted of 14,693 antihypertensive prescriptions, prescribed by 164  e-prescribing physicians for 7061 unique members. There were 2289 out of 14,693  prescriptions (15.6%) that went unfilled, affecting 24.3% of patients. Of the  prescriptions not obtained, 1466 (64%) were denied by the MCO and 823 (36%) were  reversed. Significant factors associated with first-fill failure were new  diagnosis of hypertension, new antihypertensive agent, higher co-payment, and  enrollment in a health maintenance organization or preferred provider  organization. CONCLUSIONS: Patients newly diagnosed with hypertension and those  prescribed a new antihypertensive were at particularly high risk for not  obtaining their medication. Because nearly a quarter of patients did not obtain  their initial fill of an antihypertensive prescription, future research should  determine efficient and cost-effective systems to address first-fill failure in  primary care.

AB  - Antiplatelet therapy (AT) is indicated in hypertensive patients with increased cardiovascular risk. The literature about the adequate or inadequate prescription  of AT is scarce. We conducted a prospective descriptive study to quantify  therapeutic inertia and non-guideline-recommended prescription (NGRP) of AT  (aspirinor clopidogrel or both), and to assess associated factors, calculating  the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) from multivariate models. In 2007-2009, 712  primary health-care hypertensive patients in a Spanish region were enrolled.  Inertia was defined as the lack of an AT prescription, despite being indicated by  guidelines, whereas NGRP was defined as AT prescription when there was no  guideline recommendation. We also recorded cardiovascular variables. Inertia and  NGRP were quantified for primary and secondary prevention. Of 108 patients in  secondary prevention, 53 had inertia (49.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI):  39.6-58.5%). Associated profile: female (OR=0.460, P=0.091), no dyslipidemia  (OR=0.393, P=0.048), no coronary heart disease (OR=0.215, P=0.001) and high  diastolic blood pressure (OR=1.076, P=0.016). In primary prevention, NGRP was  present in 69 of 595 patients (11.6%, 95% CI: 9.0-14.2%). Associated profile:  male (OR=1.610, P=0.089), smoking (OR=2.055, P=0.045), dyslipidemia (OR=3.227,  P<0.001) and diabetes (OR=2.795, P<0.001). Although certain factors were clearly  associated with these phenomena much still remains to be learnt.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior studies of the Medicare Part D coverage gap are limited in generalizability and scope. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the coverage  gap on drugs used for asymptomatic (antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs)  and symptomatic (pain relievers, acid suppressants, and antidepressants)  conditions in elderly patients with hypertension and hyperlipidemia. DESIGN:  Quasi-experimental study using pre-post design and contemporaneous control group.  SETTING: Medicare claims files from 2005 and 2006 for 5% random sample of  Medicare beneficiaries. PATIENTS: Part D plan enrollees with hypertension or  hyperlipidemia aged 65 years or older who had no coverage, generic-only coverage,  or both brand-name and generic coverage during the gap in 2006. Patients who were  fully eligible for the low-income subsidy served as the control group.  MEASUREMENTS: Monthly 30-day supply prescriptions available, medication  adherence, and continuous medication gaps of 30 days or more for antihypertensive  or lipid-lowering drugs; monthly 30-day supply prescriptions available for pain  relievers, acid suppressants, or antidepressants before and after coverage gap  entry. RESULTS: Patients with no gap coverage had a decrease in monthly  antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drug prescriptions during the coverage gap.  Nonadherence also increased in this group (antihypertensives: odds ratio [OR],  1.60 [95% CI, 1.50 to 1.71]; lipid-lowering drugs: OR, 1.59 [CI, 1.50 to 1.68]).  The proportion of patients with no gap coverage who had continuous medication  gaps in lipid-lowering medication use and antihypertensive use increased by an  absolute 7.3% (OR, 1.38 [CI, 1.29 to 1.46]) and 3.2% (OR, 1.35 [CI, 1.25 to  1.45]), respectively, because of the coverage gap. Decreases in use were smaller  for pain relievers and antidepressants and larger for acid suppressants in  patients with no gap coverage. Patients with generic-only coverage had decreased  use of cardiovascular medications but no change in use of drugs for symptomatic  conditions. No measures changed in the brand-name and generic coverage groups.  Results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with the main findings.  LIMITATION: Because this study was nonrandomized, unobserved differences may  still exist between study groups. CONCLUSION: The Part D coverage gap was  associated with decreased use of medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia  in patients with no gap coverage and generic-only gap coverage. The proposed  phasing out of the gap by 2020 will benefit such patients; however, use of  low-value medications may also increase.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is highly prevalent among the low-income population in the United States. This study assessed the association between Medicaid coverage  and health care service use and costs among hypertensive adults following the  enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), by income  status level. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 2,866 nonpregnant  hypertensive individuals aged 18-64 years with income up to 138% of the federal  poverty level (FPL) were selected from the 2014 and 2015 Medical Expenditure  Panel Survey. Regression analyses were performed to examine the association of  Medicaid coverage with outpatient (outpatient visits and prescription medication  fills), emergency, and acute health care service use and costs among those  potentially eligible for Medicaid by income status-the very low-income (FPL ≤  100%) and the moderately low-income (100% > FPL ≤ 138%). RESULTS: Among the study  population, 70.1% were very low-income and 29.9% were moderately low-income.  Full-year Medicaid coverage was higher among the very low-income group (41.0%)  compared with those moderately low-income (29.1%). For both income groups, having  full-year Medicaid coverage was associated with increased health care service use  and higher overall annual medical costs ($13,085 compared with $7,582 without  Medicaid); costs were highest among moderately low-income patients ($17,639).  CONCLUSION: Low-income individuals with hypertension, who were potentially newly  eligible for Medicaid under the ACA may benefit from expanded Medicaid coverage  by improving their access to outpatient services that can support chronic disease  management. However, to realize decreases in medical expenditures, efforts to  decrease their use of emergency and acute care services are likely needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine if African-American renal transplant patients who received direct patient care from a clinical pharmacist  had better blood pressure control compared to African-American renal transplant  patients who did not have clinical pharmacy services. METHODS: Renal transplant  patients were prospectively randomized into an intervention group or a control  group. Patients in the intervention group received clinical pharmacy services  that included a clinical pharmacist performing patient medication reviews, with  emphasis on preventing or resolving medication-related problems and providing  medication recommendations. Patients in the control group received routine clinic  services, but had no clinical pharmacist interaction. Analysis was performed to  detect differences between the intervention and control groups in baseline and  quarterly systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for  one year post-study enrollment. RESULTS: There were no differences between the  intervention (N = 13) and control (N = 10) groups in baseline blood pressures or  in the percentage of hypertensive patients. Significant differences in the change  in SBP and DBP from baseline between the intervention and control groups were  observed at the second, third, and fourth quarters of the study, favoring the  intervention group (P < .01). Mean SBP was significantly lower in the  intervention group at the second (137.8 +/- 15.0 vs 168.9 +/- 15.3), third (135.9  +/- 11.7 vs 164.6 +/- 20.1), and fourth (145.3 +/- 16.8 vs 175.8 +/- 33.9)  quarters of the study (P < .05). Mean DBP was significantly lower in the  intervention group at the second (76.0 +/- 11.8 vs 84.9 +/- 6.1) and fourth (77.0  +/- 10.2 vs 91.8 +/- 12.0) quarters (P < .05). CONCLUSION: Direct patient care  services provided by a clinical pharmacist, in addition to routine clinical  services, have a positive effect on the blood pressure of African-American renal  transplant patients. A multidisciplinary team that includes a clinical pharmacist  is beneficial to patient care.

TI  - Cost containment for treating hypertension in African Americans: impact of a combined ACE inhibitor-calcium channel blocker.
AU  - Kountz, D. S.
T2  - Journal of the National Medical Association
AB  - The use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has increased dramatically over the last 10 years and now  accounts for 60% to 70% of all new antihypertensive prescriptions. Even though  these two classes are efficacious, they are costly. Combined ACE inhibitor/CCB  therapy (amlodipine-benazepril) was introduced in 1995. An analysis was done to  assess the potential financial impact of substituting this agent for patients  being treated with on ACE inhibitor/CCB combination. A pharmaceutical profile  review of prescriptions during October 1995 was performed on 219 randomly  selected patients enrolled in a Medicaid managed care program. Eighty-four  profiles were analyzed; 24% of patients were on a combination ACE inhibitor/CCB  regimen with an average monthly cost of $135. If the single agent  amlodipine-benazepril with an average monthly cost of $45 (all strengths) was  substituted, the savings would be considerable: $1080 per patient per year and  $1,080,000 annualized for the calculated number of hypertensives on combination  therapy in our network of 15,000 patients. Therapeutic substitution is one method  of achieving cost containment in managed care. The cost differential between  separately prescribed CCBs and ACE inhibitors and amlodipine-benazepril is  significant. Compliance also should be enhanced as the patient would need to take  only one pill daily. Once a patient has been maintained on a stable dose of a  CCB/ACE inhibitor, substitution with amlodipine-benazepril should be considered.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous studies of antihypertensive treatment of older patients have focused on blood pressure control, cardiovascular risk or adherence, whereas  data on inappropriate antihypertensive prescriptions to older patients are  scarce. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess inappropriate  antihypertensive prescriptions to older patients. METHODS: An observational,  prospective multicentric study was conducted to assess potentially inappropriate  prescription of antihypertensive drugs, in patients aged 75 years and older with  arterial hypertension (HTN), in the month prior to hospital admission, using four  instruments: Beers, Screening Tool of Older Person's Prescriptions (STOPP),  Screening Tool to Alert Doctors to the Right Treatment (START) and Assessing Care  of Vulnerable Elders 3 (ACOVE-3). Primary care and hospital electronic records  were reviewed for HTN diagnoses, antihypertensive treatment and blood pressure  readings. RESULTS: Of 672 patients, 532 (median age 85 years, 56% female) had  HTN. 21.6% received antihypertensive monotherapy, 4.7% received no hypertensive  treatment, and the remainder received a combination of antihypertensive  therapies. The most frequently prescribed antihypertensive drugs were diuretics  (53.5%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) (41%), calcium  antagonists (32.2%), angiotensin receptor blockers (29.7%) and beta-blockers  (29.7%). Potentially inappropriate prescription was observed in 51.3% of patients  (27.8% overprescription and 35% underprescription). The most frequent  inappropriately prescribed drugs were calcium antagonists (overprescribed), ACEIs  and beta-blockers (underprescribed). ACEI and beta-blocker underprescriptions  were independently associated with heart failure admissions [beta-blockers odds  ratio (OR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-0.71, p < 0.001; ACEIs OR  0.50, 95% CI 0.36-0.70, p < 0.001]. CONCLUSION: Potentially inappropriate  prescription was detected in more than half of patients receiving  antihypertensive treatment. Underprescription was more frequent than  overprescription. ACEIs and beta-blockers were frequently underprescribed and  were associated with heart failure admissions.

AB  - PURPOSE: The effects of a medication assistance program with medication therapy management (MTM) on the clinical outcomes and health-related quality of life  (HQOL) of renal transplant recipients were studied. METHODS: All renal transplant  recipients who were enrolled in the Medication Access Program at the Medical  College of Georgia for at least one year were included in the study. Patients'  demographics, number of graft rejections (for one year pre-enrollment and one  year post-enrollment), and diagnoses of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia  were recorded and confirmed by medical and pharmacy records. The use of  antihypertensive, antidiabetic, antilipemic, and immunosuppressant agents and  laboratory values for fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)),  blood pressure, low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol,  triglycerides, and serum immunosuppressant concentrations were identified for one  year pre-enrollment and one year post-enrollment. HQOL was measured at the time  of enrollment and one year post-enrollment. RESULTS: Thirty-six adult renal  transplant recipients were included in the study. All patients had hypertension,  72% had dyslipidemia, and 42% had diabetes. Patients received significantly more  antihypertensive agents post-enrollment versus pre-enrollment (p < 0.001) and  significantly more antidiabetic agents (p = 0.004) and antilipemics (p = 0.001).  Measures of fasting blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, LDL cholesterol,  total cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure, and number of graft rejections  decreased from pre-enrollment levels (p < 0.01). A significantly greater number  of patients reached target serum cyclosporine levels post-enrollment versus  pre-enrollment (p = 0.008). HQOL was significantly increased one year  post-enrollment (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: A medication assistance program that  included MTM services improved medication access, clinical outcomes, and HQOL in  renal transplant recipients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To 1) identify barriers to medication adherence and 2) examine the relationship between the Indian Health Service (IHS) 3 prime questions and  medication adherence in patients with diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia  before and 6 months after intervention. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study  evaluated the effectiveness of an adherence program at an independent community  pharmacy. Patients who met inclusion criteria were telephoned monthly to answer  questions related to their medications. Patients served as their own controls to  show comparison between pre- and postintervention adherence rates calculated  according to proportion of days covered over the previous 6 months. Mean  medication adherences before and after intervention were assessed via paired t  test. Linear regression was used to analyze predictors of average medication  adherence. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used to measure the impact of  comorbid conditions on medication adherence. RESULTS: Fifty-six of 354 patients  met inclusion criteria, consented, and completed the study. The percentage of  patients achieving an adherence rate of 80% or more increased from 9% initially  to 59% at study completion. Each medication class showed improvement in adherence  rates: diabetes from 66.24% to 80.06% (P = 0.0153), hypertension from 72.33% to  81.34% (P = 0.0192), and hyperlipidemia from 64.45% to 74.66% (P = 0.0103).  Overall, average medication adherence increased by 11% (P < 0.0001). The top  patient-reported barrier to adherence was convenience/forgetfulness (46.43%).  CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-led counseling sessions with the use of the 3 prime  questions showed short-term improvement in adherence rates among patients  participating in a medication adherence program. Future studies should assess if  improved adherence is sustained long-term following active intervention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality is substantially higher in Russia than in neighbouring Norway. We aimed to compare blood pressure- and  lipid-lowering medication use and proportion meeting treatment targets between  general population samples in the two countries in those with CVD and diabetes.  METHODS: The study population was adults aged 40-69 years reporting a diagnosis  of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and/or diabetes participating in  cross-sectional population-based studies in Russia (Know Your Heart (KYH)  2015-18 N = 626) and Norway (The Tromsø Study 2015-16 (Tromsø 7) N = 1353).  Reported medications were coded according to the 2016 WHO Anatomical Therapeutic  Chemical Classification system. Treatment targets were defined using the Joint  European Societies guidelines for CVD prevention in clinical practice (2016).  RESULTS: Age- and sex-standardized prevalence of use of lipid-lowering  medications was higher in Tromsø 7 for all three conditions with a  disproportionately large difference in those reporting MI (+ 48% (95% CI 39,  57%)). Proportion meeting treatment targets for LDL cholesterol was poor in both  studies (age- and sex-standardized prevalence of control KYH vs Tromsø 7: MI 5.1%  vs 10.1%; stroke 11.6% vs 5.8%; diabetes 24.9% vs 23.3%). Use of antihypertensive  medication was higher in KYH for stroke (+ 40% (95% CI 30, 50%)) and diabetes  (+ 27% (95% CI 19, 34%)) groups but approximately equal for the MI group (- 1%  (95% CI -1, 1%)). Proportion meeting blood pressure targets was lower in KYH vs  Tromsø 7 (MI 51.8% vs 76.3%; stroke 49.5% vs 69.6%; diabetes 51.9% vs 63.9%).  CONCLUSIONS: We identified different patterns of medication use in people with  CVD and diabetes. However despite higher use of lipid-lowering medication in the  Norwegian study treatment to target for total cholesterol was poor in both  Russian and Norwegian studies. In contrast we found higher levels of use of  antihypertensive medications in the Russian study but also that less participants  met treatment targets for blood pressure. Further work should investigate what  factors are responsible for this seeming paradox and how management of modifiable  risk factors for secondary prevention could be improved.

TI  - Position of the American Dietetic Association: integration of medical nutrition therapy and pharmacotherapy.
T2  - Journal of the American Dietetic Association
AB  - It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that the application of medical nutrition therapy (MNT) and lifestyle counseling as a part of the  Nutrition Care Process is an integral component of the medical treatment for  management of specific disease states and conditions and should be the initial  step in the management of these situations. If optimal control cannot be achieved  with MNT alone and concurrent pharmacotherapy is required, then The Association  promotes a team approach to care for clients receiving concurrent MNT and  pharmacotherapy and encourages active collaboration among dietetics professionals  and other members of the health care team. There are a number of medical  conditions, many of them chronic, that will respond to MNT and, therefore, MNT  should be the first intervention for these conditions. In addition to being a  vital element of the optimal management and control of these conditions, MNT is  also a cost-effective method of management. However, because of the long-term  nature of these conditions, concurrent pharmacotherapy may become necessary to  achieve or maintain optimal control. In cases where this is necessary, MNT should  continue to be an integral component of the therapy because it may complement or  enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of pharmacotherapy, thereby reducing or  eliminating the need for multiple medications. The utilization of a coordinated  multidisciplinary team approach is critical to the success of the concurrent use  of MNT and pharmacotherapy because of the long-term duration of the treatments,  the necessity of monitoring compliance and effectiveness, and the likelihood of  multiple medication-nutrient interactions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between medical costs and persistence with beta blockers among hypertensive patients, and to quantify persistence related  medical cost differences with nebivolol, which is associated with improved  tolerability, versus other beta blockers. METHODS: Adults who initiated  hypertension treatment with a beta blocker were identified from the MarketScan *  claims database (2008-2012). Patients were classified based on their first beta  blocker use: nebivolol, atenolol, carvedilol, metoprolol, and other beta  blockers. Patients with compelling indications for atenolol, carvedilol or  metoprolol (acute coronary syndrome and congestive heart failure) were excluded.  Patients enrolled in health maintenance organization or capitated point of  service insurance plans were also excluded. Persistence was defined as continuous  use of the index drug (<60 day gap). The average effect of persistence on medical  costs (2012 USD) was estimated using generalized linear models (GLMs). Regression  estimates were used to predict medical cost differences associated with  persistence between nebivolol and the other cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 587,424  hypertensive patients met the inclusion criteria. Each additional month of  persistence with any one beta blocker was associated with $152.51 in all-cause  medical cost savings; continuous treatment for 1 year was associated with  $1585.98 in all-cause medical cost savings. Patients treated with nebivolol had  longer persistence during the 1 year study period (median: 315 days) than all  other beta blockers (median: 156-292 days). Longer persistence with nebivolol  translated into $305.74 all-cause medical cost savings relative to all other beta  blockers. LIMITATIONS: The results may not be generalizable to hypertensive  patients with acute coronary syndrome or congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS:  Longer persistence with beta blockers for the treatment of hypertension was  associated with lower medical costs. There may be greater cost savings due to  better persistence with nebivolol than other beta blockers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of medication copayment level and other predictors on compliance with antihypertensive medications, as measured by the  medication possession ratio. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational analysis.  METHODS: We used claims data from a large managed care organization. The  identification of subjects was based on a diagnosis of hypertension and a filled  prescription for antihypertensive medication between January 1999 and June 2004.  Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate copayment level and  patient characteristics as predictors of medication compliance. RESULTS: Analysis  of data for 114,232 patients filling prescriptions for antihypertensive  medications revealed that compliance was lower for drugs in less preferred tiers.  Relative to medications with a 5 dollars copayment, the odds ratio (95%  confidence interval) for compliance with drugs having a 20 dollars copayment was  0.76 (0.75, 0.78); for drugs requiring a 20 dollars to 165 dollars copayment, the  odds ratio for compliance was 0.48 (0.47, 0.49). Medication compliance also  differed by patient age, morbidity level, and ethnicity, as well as by medication  therapeutic class--with the best compliance observed for angiotensin receptor  blockers, followed by calcium channel blockers, beta-adrenergic receptor  antagonists (beta-blockers), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and last,  thiazide diuretics. CONCLUSIONS: Copayment level, independent of other  determinants, was found to be a strong predictor of compliance with  antihypertensive medications, with greater compliance seen among patients filing  pharmacy claims for drugs that required lower copayments. This finding suggests  that patient use is sensitive to price. The potential impact on compliance should  be considered when making pricing and policy decisions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the rate of guideline-concordant initiation of oral anticoagulation (OAC) among elderly Veterans with atrial fibrillation (AF) and  high stroke risk. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Veterans Health Administration  (VHA) Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) linked with Medicare claims 2011-2015. STUDY  DESIGN: We identified 6619 elderly, high stroke-risk patients with a new episode  of AF initially diagnosed in the VHA during fiscal years 2012-2015. We used  logistic regression to estimate marginal effects of associations between patient  characteristics and OAC initiation within 90 days of the first AF episode. DATA  EXTRACTION METHODS: We identified OACs using generic drug names. We calculated  comorbidities and risk scores using diagnosis codes from 1 year of baseline data.  PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Overall, 66.5% of Medicare-eligible Veterans with AF at high  risk of stroke initiated an OAC within 90 days. We found lower initiation rates  for patients enrolled in Medicare Part D and those ineligible for drug co-payment  subsidies. OAC initiation rates increased during the study among VHA-reliant  patients but not among dual VHA-Part D enrollees. CONCLUSIONS: One-third of  elderly Veterans at risk of stroke are not receiving recommended therapy.  Increased coordination between Medicare and VHA providers may lead to  improvements in anticoagulation quality and stroke prevention.

AB  - Wholesale data from Estonia covering all drug supplies during the period 1983-1989 have been studied using the defined daily dose (DDD) methodology. The  use of all major pharmacological groups was compared with the corresponding  statistics from the Nordic countries. The patterns of drug use showed large  differences between the Nordic countries and Estonia. Many drugs were used in  large quantities in Estonia although they are no longer considered to be  first-line medications in the Nordic countries because of their high risk to  benefit ratio. These included the pyrazolones (phenylbutazone, aminophenazone),  chloramphenicol, aminoglycoside antibiotics, and Rauwolfia alkaloids. On the  other hand, several groups of effective drugs were available in Estonia only in  limited amounts, including the histamine (H2) receptor antagonists, hormonal  contraceptives, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme  inhibitors, and cephalosporins. There were also differences in the use of  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, blood pressure lowering agents, and  anti-asthmatic drugs. Amongst the factors influencing drug usage it appears that  economic status, the ordering and invoicing routines of the pharmaceutical  services, and therapeutic traditions were the main reasons for the differences  found.

TI  - Impact of combination therapy on managed care. Based on a presentation by Lisa Latts, MD, MSPH.
T2  - The American journal of managed care
AB  - The major objectives of managed care are particularly applicable to hypertension, a very common disease that affects about 30% of the adult population. Although  managed care organizations know that adequate blood pressure control has a  considerable impact on reducing hypertension-related morbidity and mortality,  managed care is, at present, doing a generally poor job of monitoring  antihypertensive therapy. One of the major reasons for this is the difficulty in  gathering the necessary data from administrative sources; only chart review,  which is very costly and very time consuming, can provide the data needed. The  value of disease management lies in its capacity to optimize clinical and  economic outcomes as well as to improve service and quality of life, using inputs  such as cost, time, clinical resources, and patient satisfaction. Disease  management programs are instituted because they can lead to improved quality of  life and reduced costs. While the focus in managed care has traditionally been on  promoting risk modification behavior, providing patient education, and  encouraging medication compliance, the treatment of hypertension itself has not  been a major focus in most disease management programs. Measuring the  effectiveness of the hypertension treatment is, however, one of the proposed  measures for the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS 2000) to  profile health plan quality. From a managed care perspective, the potential  benefits of combination therapy for hypertension include improved blood pressure  control and improved patient compliance as a result of needing fewer pills and  experiencing fewer side effects with low-dose therapy. Among the obstacles to  combination therapy in the managed care setting are the addition of the  combinations onto a formulary and lack of acceptance among physicians. Fixed-dose  combination therapy with a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin-converting  enzyme (ACE) inhibitor can potentially reduce pharmacy costs if given to patients  who are taking both drugs independently and to patients who are taking a calcium  channel blocker but should probably also be taking an ACE inhibitor (e.g.,  patients with diabetes or congestive heart failure). A mini-pharmacoeconomic  analysis based on claims data over a 6-month period from HMO Colorado, a health  maintenance organization, shows that switching patients on dual therapy with a  calcium channel blocker and an ACE inhibitor to 1-pill combination therapy with  both agents can result in substantial cost savings.

T2  - Journal of managed care pharmacy : JMCP
AB  - BACKGROUND: Promoting use of pharmaco-economic models by formulary reviewers is a goal of the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy (AMCP) Format for Formulary  Submissions, but relatively few decision makers use such models, and many doubt  that they provide meaningful input. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate how sophisticated  disease-based pharmaco-economic models can aid formulary decision makers when  long-term outcomes data are lacking. METHODS: The Center for Outcomes Research  (CORE) Diabetes Model (CDM), a published, validated Markov pharmaco-economic  model that projects clinical and economic endpoints, was used to model the  cost-effectiveness of exenatide, a new injectable antidiabetic agent that  enhances glucose-dependent insulin secretion, in a standard cohort of type 2  diabetes patients (mean body mass index [BMI] = 27.5 3 kg/m2), compared with a  modified obese cohort (mean BMI = 35 3 kg/m2) that was otherwise demographically  identical at baseline to the standard cohort. The standard cohort was assumed to  maintain baseline weight during treatment, and the modified obese cohort was  assumed to experience weight loss of approximately 9% (mean = 3 kg/m2), with  corresponding improvements in blood pressure, low density lipoprotein  cholesterol, and triglycerides. We selected a 30-year time horizon because it was  the time interval during which the CDM predicted most of the subjects would have  died, and the costs obtained thus reasonably projected lifetime total direct  medical costs for these cohorts. While treatment options certainly will change  over a 30-year period, our goal was to estimate the incremental effect of  exenatide over other available therapies. RESULTS: The model predicted reduced  long-term treatment costs in obese patients, driven by an 11% decrease in  cardiovascular disease burden and derived from the presumed weight loss. The  incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for adding exenatide over 3 years was  35,000 dollars/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Using a 30-year horizon, ICER  values were 13,000 dollars/QALY versus insulin, 32,000 dollars versus generic  glyburide, and 16,000 dollars versus no additional treatment. Exenatide dominated  pioglitazone. By comparison, the 30-year ICER for exenatide versus insulin in the  nonobese cohort was 33,000 dollars. These results were presented to the pharmacy  and therapeutics (P&T) committee and influenced its decision to add exenatide to  the drug formulary. While our modeling assumed certain patient characteristics  (e.g., obesity, need of further A1c reduction at baseline, motivation to lose  weight), the P&T committee imposed only a step-therapy requirement to try either  metformin or a sulfonylurea before trying exenatide and did adopt a nonspecific  requirement for physician reauthorization of refills before the fourth pharmacy  claim for exenatide. CONCLUSIONS: Disease-based pharmaco-economic models may help  third party payers project costs and be particularly useful when only data from  short-term clinical trials are available. In the present case, the pharmacy staff  of a health plan used a pharmaco-economic model for drug treatment of type 2  diabetes provided by the manufacturer as part of the AMCP Format dossier process  to project cost outcomes for exenatide, adjunct injectable therapy for patients  taking metformin and/or sulfonylurea. The P&T committee approved the drug for  inclusion in the drug formulary based in part on the results of the  pharmaco-economic model produced from the cost inputs entered into the model by  the health plan pharmacists.

T2  - Journal of managed care pharmacy : JMCP
AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication therapy management (MTM) was officially recognized by the federal government in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and  Modernization Act of 2003, which requires Medicare Part D plans that offer  prescription drug coverage to establish MTM programs (MTMPs) for eligible  beneficiaries. Even though the term "MTM" was first used in 2003, pharmacists  have provided similar services since the term "pharmaceutical care" was  introduced in 1990. Fairview Health Services, a large integrated health care  system, implemented a standardized pharmaceutical care service system in 1998,  naming it a pharmaceutical care-based MTM practice in 2006. OBJECTIVE: To present  the clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes of 10 years of delivering MTM  services to patients in a health care delivery system. METHODS: Data from MTM  services provided to 9,068 patients and documented in electronic therapeutic  records were retrospectively analyzed over the 10-year period from September 1998  to September 2008 in 1 health system with 48 primary care clinics. Patients  eligible for MTM services were aged 21 years or older and either paid for MTM out  of pocket or met their health care payer's criteria for MTM reimbursement; the  criteria varied for Medicaid, Medicare, and commercially insured enrollees. All  MTM was delivered face to face. Health data extracted from the electronic  therapeutic record by the present study's investigators included patient  demographics, medication list, medical conditions, drug therapy problems  identified and addressed, change in clinical status, and pharmacist-estimated  cost savings. The clinical status assessment was a comparison of the first and  most recent MTM visit to measure whether the patient achieved the goals of  therapy for each medical condition (e.g., the blood pressure of a patient with  diabetes and hypertension will be less than 130/80 millimeters mercury [mmHg] in  1 month; the patient with allergic rhinitis will be relieved of his complaints of  nasal congestion, runny nose, and eye itching within 5 days). Goals were set  according to evidence-based literature and patient-specific targets determined  cooperatively by pharmacists, patients, and physicians. Cost-savings calculations  represented MTM pharmacists' estimates of medical services (e.g., office visits,  laboratory services, urgent care visits, emergency room visits) and lost work  time avoided by the intervention. All short-term (3-month) estimated health care  savings that resulted from addressing drug therapy problems were analyzed. The  expenses of these avoided services were calculated using the health system's  contracted rates for services provided in the last quarter of 2008. The return on  investment (ROI) was calculated by dividing the pharmacist-estimated savings by  the cost of MTM services in 2008 (number of MTM encounters times the average cost  of an MTM visit). The humanistic impact of MTM services was assessed using the  results from the second patient satisfaction survey administered in 2008 (new  patients seen from January through December 2008) for the health system's MTM  program. RESULTS: A total of 9,068 patient records were in the documentation  system as of September 30, 2008. During the 10-year period, there were 33,706  documented encounters (mean 3.7 encounters per patient). Of 38,631 drug therapy  problems identified and addressed by MTM pharmacists, the most frequent were a  need for additional drug therapy (n = 10,870, 28.1%) and subtherapeutic dosage (n  = 10,100, 26.1%). In the clinical status assessment of the 12,851 medical  conditions in 4,849 patients who were not at goal when they enrolled in the  program, 7,068 conditions (55.0%) improved, 2,956 (23.0%) were unchanged, and  2,827 (22.0%) worsened during the course of MTM services. Pharmacist-estimated  cost savings to the health system over the 10-year period were $2,913,850 ($86  per encounter) and the total cost of MTM was $2,258,302 ($67 per encounter), for  an estimated ROI of $1.29 per $1 in MTM administrative costs. In the patient  satisfaction survey, 95.3% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that their  overall health and wellbeing had improved because of MTM. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist  estimates of the impact of an MTM program in a large integrated health care  system suggest that the program was associated with improved clinical outcomes  and cost savings. Patient satisfaction with the program was high.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To further develop and evaluate a diabetes disease state management (DSM) program that provided direct patient care responsibilities to advanced  pharmacy practice experience (APPE) students as members of healthcare teams.  DESIGN: Nine new clinics and 3 established sites that provide self-care  management education to patients with diabetes were established and maintained in  rural Colorado pharmacies and supported by students in APPE training for 48 weeks  per year. EVALUATION: The 12 clinics provided 120 APPE student placements in  2010-2011. Students' perceptions of their experiences were positive. Patients who  completed the student-supported diabetes self-management education program had  improvements in blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid values. CONCLUSIONS:  Twelve diabetes DSM clinics provided direct patient care opportunities to APPE  students working as part of healthcare teams while expanding healthcare resources  in underserved communities in Colorado.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of registry studies have reported suboptimal adherence to guidelines for cardiovascular prevention during the first year after acute  myocardial infarction (AMI). However, only a few studies have addressed long-term  secondary prevention after AMI. This study evaluates prevention guideline  adherence and outcome of guideline-directed secondary prevention in patients  surviving 2 years after AMI. METHODS: Patients aged 18-85 years at the time of  their index AMI were consecutively identified from hospital discharge records  between July 2010 and December 2011 in Gothenburg, Sweden. All patients who  agreed to participate in the study (16.2%) were invited for a structured  interview, physical examinations and laboratory analysis 2 years after AMI.  Guideline-directed secondary preventive goals were defined as optimally  controlled blood pressure, serum cholesterol, glucose, regular physical activity,  smoking cessation and pharmacological treatment. RESULTS: The mean age of the  study cohort (n = 200) at the index AMI was 63.0 ± 9.7 years, 79% were men. Only  3.5% of the cohort achieved all six guideline-directed secondary preventive goals  2 years after infarction. LDL < 1.8 mmol/L was achieved in 18.5% of the cohort,  regular exercise in 45.5% and systolic blood pressure <140 mmHg in 57.0%.  Anti-platelet therapy was used by 97% of the patients, beta-blockers by 83.0%,  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers by 76.5%  and statins by 88.5%. During follow-up, non-fatal adverse cardiovascular events  (cardiac hospitalization, recurrent acute coronary syndrome, angina pectoris, new  percutaneous coronary intervention, new onset of atrial fibrillation,  post-infarct heart failure, pacemaker implantation, stroke/transient ischemic  attack (TIA), cardiac surgery and cardiac arrest) occurred in 47% of the cohort  and readmission due to cardiac causes in 30%. CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed the  failure of secondary prevention in our daily clinical practice and high rate of  non-fatal adverse cardiovascular events 2 years after AMI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore treatment patterns and resource utilization and cost for subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). RESEARCH DESIGN:  Retrospective claims database analysis of 706 patients with PAH enrolled in a  large, geographically diverse US managed-care organization. RESULTS: In the final  sample of PAH patients treated with bosentan (n=251) or sildenafil (n=455),  average age was 57 years, 86% of patients were commercially insured, and 52% of  patients were male. Gender distribution varied significantly across subgroups,  with a lower proportion of males in the bosentan (30%) subgroup compared with the  sildenafil group (64%) (p<0.001). Average baseline Charlson comorbidity score was  2.4. Average numbers of fills per month were 0.8 and 0.4 for bosentan and  sildenafil patients, respectively (p<0.001). Over 80% of patients received only  one PAH treatment in the first 90 days following the index date, with 28% of  bosentan and 13% of sildenafil patients receiving combination therapy (p<0.001).  Over one-third of bosentan patients and one-quarter of sildenafil patients  experienced a dose increase in the follow-up period (p=0.009). Sixteen percent of  sildenafil patients experienced a dose decrease in the follow-up period, while a  smaller proportion of patients receiving bosentan (4%) experienced a dose  decrease (p<0.001). On average, number of PAH-related per subject per month  (PSPM) inpatient stays and emergency department visits and PSPM length of  inpatient stays were statistically similar between the subgroups. PAH-related  PSPM healthcare costs were high for both subgroups, with average monthly costs of  $5,332 and $3,632 among bosentan and sildenafil patients, respectively (p=0.003).  Differences in total costs were driven mainly by differences in pharmacy  expenditures. CONCLUSIONS: Of the oral agents approved for treating PAH at the  time of this study, sildenafil was most commonly prescribed as index therapy and  was also associated with the lowest costs, largely due to significantly lower  pharmacy costs. This study is characterized by limitations inherent to claims  database analyses, such as the potential for coding errors and lack of  information on whether a drug was taken as prescribed. Furthermore, PAH severity  (WHO functional class) was not assessed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood pressure (BP) is poorly controlled among a large proportion of hypertensive outpatients. Innovative models of care are therefore needed to  improve BP control. The Team-Based Care for improving Hypertension management  (TBC-HTA) study aims to evaluate the effect of a team-based care (TBC)  interprofessional intervention, involving nurses, community pharmacists and  physicians, on BP control of hypertensive outpatients compared to usual care in  routine clinical practice. METHODS/DESIGN: The TBC-HTA study is a pragmatic  randomized controlled study with a 6-month follow-up which tests a TBC  interprofessionnal intervention conducted among uncontrolled treated hypertensive  outpatients in two ambulatory clinics and among seven nearby community pharmacies  in Lausanne and Geneva, Switzerland. A total of 110 patients are being recruited  and randomized to TBC (TBC: N = 55) or usual care group (UC: N = 55). Patients  allocated to the TBC group receive the TBC intervention conducted by an  interprofessional team, involving an ambulatory clinic nurse, a community  pharmacist and a physician. A nurse and a community pharmacist meet patients  every 6 weeks to measure BP, to assess lifestyle, to estimate medication  adherence, and to provide education to the patient about disease, treatment and  lifestyle. After each visit, the nurse and pharmacist write a summary report with  recommendations related to medication adherence, lifestyle, and changes in  therapy. The physician then adjusts antihypertensive therapy accordingly.  Patients in the UC group receive usual routine care without sessions with a nurse  and a pharmacist. The primary outcome is the difference in daytime ambulatory BP  between TBC and UC patients at 6-month of follow-up. Secondary outcomes include  patients' and healthcare professionals' satisfaction with the TBC intervention  and BP control at 12 months (6 months after the end of the intervention).  DISCUSSION: This ongoing study aims to evaluate the effect of a newly developed  team-based care intervention engaging different healthcare professionals on BP  control in a primary care setting in Switzerland. The results will inform  policymakers on implementable strategies for routine clinical practice. TRIAL  REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT02511093 .

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with diabetes have poor blood pressure (BP) control. Pharmacological therapy is the cornerstone of effective BP treatment, yet there  are high rates both of poor medication adherence and failure to intensify  medications. Successful medication management requires an effective partnership  between providers who initiate and increase doses of effective medications and  patients who adhere to the regimen. METHODS: In this cluster-randomized  controlled effectiveness study, primary care teams within sites were randomized  to a program led by a clinical pharmacist trained in motivational  interviewing-based behavioral counseling approaches and authorized to make BP  medication changes or to usual care. This study involved the collection of data  during a 14-month intervention period in three Department of Veterans Affairs  facilities and two Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities. The clinical  pharmacist was supported by clinical information systems that enabled proactive  identification of, and outreach to, eligible patients identified on the basis of  poor BP control and either medication refill gaps or lack of recent medication  intensification. The primary outcome is the relative change in systolic blood  pressure (SBP) measurements over time. Secondary outcomes are changes in  Hemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), medication adherence  determined from pharmacy refill data, and medication intensification rates.  DISCUSSION: Integration of the three intervention elements--proactive  identification, adherence counseling and medication intensification--is essential  to achieve optimal levels of control for high-risk patients. Testing the  effectiveness of this intervention at the team level allows us to study the  program as it would typically be implemented within a clinic setting, including  how it integrates with other elements of care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend education, physical activity and changes in diet for type 2 diabetes patients, yet the composition and organization of  non-pharmacological care are still controversial. Therefore, it is very important  that programmes aiming to improve non-pharmacological treatment of type 2  diabetes are developed and evaluated. The Copenhagen Type 2 Diabetes  Rehabilitation Project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a new group-based  lifestyle rehabilitation programme in a Health Care Centre in primary care.  METHODS/DESIGN: The group-based diabetes rehabilitation programme consists of  empowerment-based education, supervised exercise and dietary intervention. The  effectiveness of this multi-disciplinary intervention is compared with  conventional individual counselling in a Diabetes Outpatient Clinic and evaluated  in a prospective and randomized controlled trial. During the recruitment period  of 18 months 180 type 2 diabetes patients will be randomized to the intervention  group and the control group. Effects on glycaemic control, quality of life,  self-rated diabetes symptoms, body composition, blood pressure, lipids, insulin  resistance, beta-cell function and physical fitness will be examined after 6, 12  and 24 months. DISCUSSION: The Copenhagen Type 2 Diabetes Rehabilitation Project  evaluates a multi-disciplinary non-pharmacological intervention programme in a  primary care setting and provides important information about how to organize  non-pharmacological care for type 2 diabetes patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medications are an integral component of management for many chronic conditions, and suboptimal adherence limits medication effectiveness among  persons with multiple chronic conditions (MCC). Medical homes may provide a  mechanism for increasing adherence among persons with MCC, thereby enhancing  management of chronic conditions. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between  medical home enrollment and adherence to newly initiated medications among  Medicaid enrollees with MCC. RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study  comparing Community Care of North Carolina medical home enrollees to nonenrollees  using merged North Carolina Medicaid claims data (fiscal years 2008-2010).  SUBJECTS: Among North Carolina Medicaid-enrolled adults with MCC, we created  separate longitudinal cohorts of new users of antidepressants (N=9303),  antihypertensive agents (N=12,595), oral diabetic agents (N=6409), and statins  (N=9263). MEASURES: Outcomes were the proportion of days covered (PDC) on  treatment medication each month for 12 months and a dichotomous measure of  adherence (PDC>0.80). Our primary analysis utilized person-level fixed effects  models. Sensitivity analyses included propensity score and person-level  random-effect models. RESULTS: Compared with nonenrollees, medical home enrollees  exhibited higher PDC by 4.7, 6.0, 4.8, and 5.1 percentage points for depression,  hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, respectively (P's<0.001). The  dichotomous adherence measure showed similar increases, with absolute differences  of 4.1, 4.5, 3.5, and 4.6 percentage points, respectively (P's<0.001).  CONCLUSIONS: Among Medicaid enrollees with MCC, adherence to new medications is  greater for those enrolled in medical homes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gender concordance between patients and their physicians is related to prevention screening and other quality indicators. Research suggests female  physicians may place greater emphasis on preventive care than male physicians;  however, little is known about whether physician gender and patient-physician  gender concordance are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor  levels and treatment. Our objective was to examine associations between patient  gender, physician gender, and their interaction with CVD risk factor control,  medication adherence, and treatment intensification in diabetes. METHODS: In this  study, 157,458 Kaiser Permanente Northern California adult diabetes patients with  a primary care physician (PCP) were assessed for above target levels of  hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (>or=8%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)  (>or=100 mg/dL), and systolic blood pressure (SBP>or=130 mm Hg) in 2005.  Medication adherence and appropriate CVD treatment intensification were assessed  using pharmacy data. Probit models assessed the adjusted marginal effects of  patient gender, PCP gender, and their interaction on control, adherence, and  intensification. RESULTS: Female patients had lower adjusted rates of LDL-C (46%  vs. 55%, p<0.001) and SBP control (52% vs. 60%, p<0.001) than males. Female  patients of female PCPs had the highest adjusted rates of HbA1c control of the  four patient-physician gender dyads (70% vs. 66%-68%, p<0.05). Male patients were  more likely than female patients to receive treatment intensification for high  SBP (60% vs. 57%, p<0.001). Female PCPs were more likely than their male  counterparts to intensify therapy for hyperlipidemia and hypertension.  CONCLUSIONS: Patient and physician gender and gender concordance are modestly  associated with CVD risk factor control and treatment in diabetes. Further  understanding of these differences could lead to improved CVD outcomes for women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with high blood pressure (BP) visit a physician an average of 4 times or more per year in the U.S., yet BP is controlled in fewer than half.  Practical, robust and sustainable models are needed to improve BP in patients  with uncontrolled hypertension. OBJECTIVES: The Home Blood Pressure  Telemonitoring and Case Management to Control Hypertension study (HyperLink) is a  cluster-randomized trial designed to determine whether an intervention that  combines home BP telemonitoring with pharmacist case management improves BP  control compared to usual care at 6 and 12 months in patients with uncontrolled  hypertension. Secondary outcomes are maintenance of BP control at 18 months,  patient satisfaction with their health care, and costs of care. METHODS:  HyperLink enrolled 450 hypertensive patients with uncontrolled BP from 16 primary  care clinics. Eight clinics were randomized to provide usual care (UC) to their  patients (n=222) and 8 were randomized to provide the telemonitoring intervention  (TI) (n=228). TI patients received home BP telemonitors that internally store and  electronically transmit BP data to a secure database. Pharmacist case managers  adjust antihypertensive therapy based on the home BP data under a collaborative  practice agreement with the clinics' primary care teams. The length of the  intervention is 12 months, with follow-up to 18 months to determine the  durability of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: We will test in a real primary care  setting whether combining BP telemonitoring and pharmacist case management can  achieve and maintain high rates of BP control compared to usual care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality in the United States, representing the highest total expenditures among major diseases.  To improve CVD-associated outcomes, medication therapy management (MTM) services  have been included in essential health benefit packages offered by various health  plans. Nevertheless, the impact of such MTM services on outcomes is still  unclear, especially from the perspective of the self-insured employer.   OBJECTIVES: To (a) compare economic outcomes between patients who received and  those who did not receive MTM services from the self-insured employer's  perspective and (b) compare clinical outcomes before and after receiving MTM  services.  METHODS: This study consisted of 2 pre- and post-retrospective  designs: (1) a cohort study with comparison groups and (2) a cohort study within  group comparison. Patients were beneficiaries aged 19 years or older who were  diagnosed with CVD conditions according to ICD-9-CM codes and continuously  enrolled in a public university-sponsored insurance plan between 2008-2010.  Patients were divided into MTM and non-MTM groups. The first MTM encounter was  assigned as the index date for the MTM group. Match-paired patients who did not  receive MTM services were randomly assigned the index date based on age category,  gender, and comorbidity. Measures for pharmacy, medical, and total expenditures  were obtained from medical and pharmacy claims. Paired t-tests and independent  t-tests using data generated from 1000 bootstraps compared mean cost difference  within and between groups. The return on investment (ROI) was calculated by  dividing the average net benefit from MTM services by the average cost of MTM  services. Clinical parameters, including blood pressure (BP) and body mass index  (BMI), were retrieved from electronic medical records from a pharmacist-provided  clinic where MTM services took place. Paired-t tests were used to compare the  mean difference between baseline and endpoint values. Further, this study  examined changes in the proportion of patients who achieved an individualized  treatment goal for BP and BMI. The study also quantified the improvement in  disease stages after the index date using the McNemar's test. Statistical  analyses were performed by using SAS software version 9.2 with statistical  significance level of 0.05.   RESULTS: A total of 63 patients and 62 match-paired  patients were included in the MTM group and the non-MTM group, respectively. The  mean cost (SD) per patient in the MTM group during the 6 months post-index period  for CVD-related pharmacy, all-cause medical, and total expenditures was lower  than the 6 months pre-index period by $22.0 (19.1), $79.2 (99.6), and $75.1  (136.2), respectively. In contrast, the mean cost (SD) for the non-MTM group  increased during the 6 months post-index date by $10.7 (24.2), $246.4 (248.4),  and $289.0 (269.5) for pharmacy, medical, and total  expenditure, respectively.  When comparing the 2 groups, the MTM group had statistically significantly lower  costs per patient for pharmacy expenditures (difference of -31.9 ± 25.1, P  less  than  0.0001), medical expenditures (difference of -$325.6 ± 271.2, P  less than  0.0001), and total direct expenditures (difference of -$359.3 ± 219.2, P  less  than  0.0001). Given the net benefit of MTM services ($359.3) and the average  cost of MTM service ($134.6), the ROI was $1.67 per $1 in MTM cost. Regarding  clinical outcomes, while no statistically significant differences were observed  in clinical outcomes, MTM services demonstrated clinical benefits. At the  post-index period, the percentage of patients who had achieved their goals  increased from 55% to 70% for BP and from 13.0% to 21.7% for normal BMI compared  with the pre-index period. In terms of the extent of improvement in disease  stages, clinical improvements in the stages of hypertension (χ2 =12.77, P  less  than  0.05) as well as BMI (χ2 =6.39, P  less than  0.05) at the endpoint were  observed.  CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular-related pharmacy, all-cause medical, and  total expenditures were statistically lower among beneficiaries who received MTM  services compared with those who did not. In addition, MTM services had a  positive ROI and demonstrated clinical significances by the increasing number of  patients who achieved treatment goals and improved disease stages for  hypertension and BMI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adherence to cardioprotective medications in the year after acute coronary syndrome hospitalization is generally poor and is associated with  increased risk of rehospitalization and mortality. Few interventions have  specifically targeted this high-risk patient population to improve medication  adherence. We hypothesize that a multifaceted patient-centered intervention could  improve adherence to cardioprotective medications. METHODS AND RESULTS: To  evaluate this intervention, we propose enrolling 280 patients with a recent acute  coronary syndrome event into a multicenter randomized, controlled trial. The  intervention comprises 4 main components: (1) pharmacist-led medication  reconciliation and tailoring; (2) patient education; (3) collaborative care  between pharmacist and primary care provider/cardiologist; and (4) 2 types of  voice messaging (educational and medication refill reminder calls). Patients in  the intervention arm will visit with the study pharmacist ≈1 week post-hospital  discharge. The pharmacist will work with the patient and collaborate with  providers to reconcile medication issues. Voice messages will augment the  educational process and remind patients to refill their cardioprotective  medications. The study will compare the intervention versus usual care for 12  months. The primary outcome of interest is adherence using the ReComp method.  Secondary and tertiary outcomes include achievement of targets for blood pressure  and low-density lipoprotein, and reduction in the combined cardiovascular end  points of myocardial infarction hospitalization, coronary revascularization, and  all-cause mortality. Finally, we will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the  intervention compared with usual care. CONCLUSIONS: If the intervention is  effective in improving medication adherence and demonstrating a lower cost, the  intervention has the potential to improve cardiovascular outcomes in this  high-risk patient population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients living in rural communities often experience pronounced health disparities, have a higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension, and  poorer access to care compared to urban areas. To address these unmet healthcare  service needs, an established, academic-based MTM provider created a novel,  collaborative program to provide comprehensive, telephonic services to patients  living in rural Arizona counties. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the program  effectiveness and described differences in health process and outcome measures  (e.g., clinical outcomes, gaps in care for prescribed medications,  medication-related problems) between individuals residing in different  rural-urban commuting area (RUCA) groups (urban, micropolitan, and small town) in  rural Arizona counties. METHODS: Subjects eligible for inclusion were 18 years or  older with diabetes and/or hypertension, living in rural Arizona counties. Data  were collected on: demographic characteristics, medical conditions, clinical  values, gaps in care, medication-related problems (MRPs), and health promotion  guidance. Subjects were analyzed using 3 intra-county RUCA levels (i.e., urban,  micropolitan, and small town). RESULTS: A total of 384 patients were included  from: urban (36.7%), micropolitan (19.3%) and small town (44.0%) areas. Positive  trends were observed for clinical values, gaps in care, and MRPs between initial  and follow-up consultations. Urban dwellers had significantly lower average SBP  values at follow-up than those from small towns (p < 0.05). A total of 192 MRPs  were identified; 75.0% were resolved immediately or referred to providers and  16.7% were accepted by prescribers. CONCLUSION: This academic-community  partnership highlights the benefits of innovative collaborative programs, such as  this, for individuals living in underserved, rural areas.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Throughout the 1990s, the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommended initial  antihypertensive therapy with a thiazide diuretic or a beta-blocker based on  evidence from randomized, controlled trials, unless an indication existed for  another drug class. The committee also recommended beta-blockers in hypertensive  patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI), and angiotensin-converting  enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Our  objective was to determine whether prescribing practices for older hypertensive  patients are consistent with evidence-based guidelines. METHODS: We examined  prescription patterns from January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1995 for 23,748  patients 65 years or older with a new diagnosis of hypertension from the New  Jersey Medicaid program and that state's Pharmacy Assistance for the Aged and  Disabled program (PAAD). We linked drug use data with information on demographic  variables and comorbid medical conditions. RESULTS: During the study period,  calcium channel blockers were the most commonly prescribed initial therapy for  hypertension (41%), followed by ACE inhibitors (24%), thiazide diuretics (17%),  and beta-blockers (10%). Eliminating patients with diabetes mellitus, CHF,  angina, or history of MI did not substantially affect these results. Overall,  initial use of a thiazide declined from 22% in 1991 to 10% in 1995, while initial  use of a calcium channel blocker increased from 28% to 43%, despite publication  during these years of studies demonstrating a benefit of thiazides in older  patients. Only 15% of older hypertensive patients with a history of MI received  beta-blockers. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing practices for older hypertensive patients  are not consistent with evidence-based guidelines. Interventions are needed to  encourage evidence-driven prescribing practices for the treatment of  hypertension.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Aggregate pharmacy claims available within an electronic health record (EHR) provide an opportunity to understand primary nonadherence in real  time. The objective of this study was to use pharmacy claims data available  within the EHR to identify the prevalence and predictors of primary nonadherence  to antihypertensive drug therapy in a multi-payer primary care network. STUDY  DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients prescribed a new  antihypertensive medication in a large primary care practice network between  January 2011 and September 2012. METHODS: We matched prescriptions for the new  antihypertensive to pharmacy claims listed in the EHR. The primary outcome was  the presence of a fill for the new medication within 30 days of the prescription.  RESULTS: Of 791 patients in our study cohort, two-thirds (522; 66%) filled their  prescription within 30 days. The majority (409; 78.4%) of that group filled the  prescription on the day it was issued. Lower diastolic blood pressure and  Medicare coverage increased the probability of nonadherence. CONCLUSIONS:  Medication fill data within the provider EHR can identify primary nonadherence in  clinical practice. As adoption of this technology increases, it provides an  opportunity to identify nonadherence, allowing for the effective design of  interventions to improve adherence to therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services (CMS) Plan Quality and Performance Program, or Star Ratings Program, allows Medicare beneficiaries to  compare quality of care among available Medicare Advantage prescription drug  (MA-PD) plans and stand-alone prescription drug plans (PDPs). Health plans have  increased intervention efforts and applied existing care management  infrastructure as an approach to improving member medication adherence and  subsequent Part D star rating performance. Independent Care Health Plan (iCare),  an MA-PD plan; MedImpact Healthcare Systems, Inc. (MedImpact), a pharmacy  benefits manager; and US MED, a mail order pharmacy, partnered to engage and  enroll iCare's dual-eligible special needs population in an intervention designed  to improve patient medication adherence and health plan performance for 3 Part D  patient safety outcome measures: Medication Adherence for Oral Diabetes  Medications (ODM), Medication Adherence for Hypertension (HTN), and Medication  Adherence for Cholesterol (CHOL). OBJECTIVES: To (a) assess the effectiveness of  a coordinated member-directed medication adherence intervention and (b) determine  the overall impact of the intervention on adherence rates and CMS Part D star  rating adherence measures.  METHODS: Administrative pharmacy claims and health  plan eligibility data from MedImpact's databases were used to identify members  using 3 target medication classes. Adherence was estimated by the proportion of  days covered (PDC) for all members. Those members considered at high risk for  nonadherence were prioritized for care management services. Risk factors were  based on members' use of more than 1 target medication class, newly started  therapy, and suboptimal adherence (PDC  less than  80%) in the most recent  6-month period. Data files listing member adherence rates and contact information  were formatted and loaded monthly into iCare's care management system, which  triggered an alert for care coordinators to counsel members on the importance of  adherence and offer the members an option for monthly 30-day supply medication  delivery via US MED. Member adherence rates were calculated 9 months pre- and  postimplementation for all members and adjusted by length of member enrollment  based on CMS technical specifications. Regression analysis assessed pre-post  changes in rates comparing 2 intervention groups: (1) members receiving iCare  counseling only (iCare-only) and (2) members receiving counseling and medication  delivery (iCare + US MED). To evaluate the overall impact of the intervention,  iCare's adherence rates and iCare's measure-specific star ratings for the 2011  and 2012 calendar years (CMS measurement years) were compared with the national  MA-PD plan contract average and with a health plan similar in member  characteristics but without adherence intervention exposure.  RESULTS: A total of  2,700 members were initially targeted for referral to iCare care management and  US MED customer service specialist teams. Between April 2012 (implementation  date) and January 2013, 1,302 (48.2%) members enrolled in the US MED component of  the intervention. Seventy-six percent of identified members were nonadherent  (PDC  less than  80%) to 1 of the 3 target medication classes, and 32% of members  were nonadherent to more than 1 target medication class. Pre-post absolute  average adherence rates increased for the iCare-only group (ODM = 15.1,  HTN = 10.1, CHOL = 13.6) and the iCare-US MED group (ODM = 30.9, HTN = 25.5,  CHOL = 29.4).  From 2011 to 2012, iCare adherence rates increased by absolute  differences of 15.2, 9.2, and 10.1 percentage points for ODM, HTN, and CHOL  measures, respectively, compared with the average MA-PD plan contract differences  (1.1, 2.1, and 2.5) and the comparator health plan differences (-2.7, -1.4, and  -4.1). Increases in iCare's adherence rates were associated with significant  increases in iCare's 2014 adherence measure star ratings (1 star to 3 stars for  ODM and CHOL, 1 star to 2 stars for HTN), which contributed to increases in the  Drug Plan Quality Improvement measure (2 stars to 4 stars) and iCare's overall  Part D star rating (3 to 3.5 stars).  CONCLUSIONS: Members in this MA-PD plan  dual-eligible population benefited from multiple points of contact to achieve  increased adherence. Health plans can use network pharmacies, care management  staff, and their pharmacy benefits managers to collaborate and implement  interventions aimed to improve members' adherence to targeted maintenance  medications and overall health plan quality performance and star ratings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide program methodology and outcomes data identifying the impact of clinical pharmacy services (CPSs) in patients with type 2 diabetes.  DESIGN: Longitudinal pre-post cohort study. SETTING: Regional primary care group  in Buffalo, NY, during 2006-2007. PATIENTS: Patients with type 2 diabetes  identified by their primary care providers were referred to the MedSense program;  a pharmacist-led, patient-centered pharmacotherapy management program developed  through university collaboration with a regional primary care physician group.  INTERVENTIONS: Education, clinical assessments, provider recommendations, and  longitudinal follow-up of treatment goals provided by MedSense pharmacists. MAIN  OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical outcomes were followed for 1 year from the index date  for primary diabetes endpoints (glycosylated hemoglobin and fasting plasma  glucose) and accompanying metabolic parameters (body mass index, blood pressure,  low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and  triglycerides). Economic endpoints from the payer perspective were also followed  for 1 year from the index date for medical and prescription-related costs.  RESULTS: Primary diabetes endpoints were significantly reduced versus baseline at  the 6-month (-1.1%; P < 0.0001, -39 mg/dL; P = 0.003) and 12-month (-1.1%; P <  0.0001, -35 mg/dL; P = 0.005) assessments. Improvement rates were observed for  all accompanying metabolic parameters at each assessment (range 40-64%).  Geometric mean costs tended to decrease versus baseline at 6-month (-$84; P =  0.785) and 12-month (-$216; P = 0.414) assessments, despite nominal increases in  diabetes and total medication costs. CONCLUSION: In this CPS model, there were  initial and sustained reductions in the primary diabetes endpoints and a high  rate of improvement for accompanying metabolic parameters. Concurrent with  clinical improvements, total direct medical costs were reduced despite an  increase in antidiabetic medication and total medication costs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary care providers do not routinely follow guidelines for the care of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Multidisciplinary efforts may  improve care for patients with chronic disease. Pharmacist based interventions  have effectively improved management of hypertension. We performed a pragmatic,  randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a pharmacist based quality  improvement program on 1) outcomes for patients with CKD and 2) adherence to CKD  guidelines in the primary care setting. METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe  CKD receiving primary care services at one of thirteen community-based Veterans  Affairs outpatient clinics were randomized to a multifactorial intervention that  included a phone-based pharmacist intervention, pharmacist-physician  collaboration, patient education, and a CKD registry (n = 1070) or usual care  (n = 1129). The primary process outcome was measurement of parathyroid hormone  (PTH) during the one year study period. The primary clinical outcome was blood  pressure (BP) control in subjects with poorly controlled hypertension at  baseline. RESULTS: Among those with poorly controlled baseline BP, there was no  difference in the last recorded BP or the percent at goal BP during the study  period (42.0% vs. 41.2% in the control arm). Subjects in the intervention arm  were more likely to have a PTH measured during the study period (46.9% vs. 16.1%  in the control arm, P <0.001) and were on more classes of antihypertensive  medications at the end of the study (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: A one-time  pharmacist based intervention proved feasible in patients with CKD. While the  intervention did not improve BP control, it did improve guideline adherence and  increased the number of antihypertensive medications prescribed to subjects with  poorly controlled BP. These findings can inform the design of quality improvement  programs and future studies which are needed to improve care of patients with  CKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01290614.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nearly half of Americans with diagnosed hypertension have uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) while some integrated healthcare systems, such  as Kaiser Permanente Northern California, have achieved control rates upwards  90%. METHODS AND RESULTS: We adapted Kaiser Permanente's evidence-based treatment  protocols in a racially and ethnically diverse population at 12 safety-net  clinics in the San Francisco Health Network. The intervention consisted of 4  elements: a hypertension registry, a simplified treatment intensification  protocol that included fixed-dose combination medications containing diuretics,  standardized BP measurement protocol, and BP check visits led by registered nurse  and pharmacist staff. The study population comprised patients with hypertension  who made ≥1 primary care visits within the past 24 months (n=15 917) and had a  recorded BP measurement within the past 12 months. We conducted a  postintervention time series analysis from August 2014 to August 2016 to assess  the effect of the intervention on BP control for 24 months for the pilot site and  for 15 months for 11 other San Francisco Health Network clinics combined.  Secondary outcomes were changes in use of guideline-recommended medication  prescribing. Rates of BP control increased at the pilot site (68%-74%; P<0.01)  and the 11 other San Francisco Health Network clinic sites (69%-74%; P<0.01).  Statistically significant improvements in BP control rates (P<0.01) at the 11 San  Francisco Health Network clinic sites occurred in all racial and ethnic groups  (blacks, 60%-66%; whites, 69%-75%; Latinos, 67%-72%; Asians, 78%-82%). Use of  fixed-dose combination medications increased from 10% to 13% (P<0.01), and the  percentage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prescriptions dispensed in  combination with a thiazide diuretic increased from 36% to 40% (P<0.01).  CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based system approaches to improving BP control can be  implemented in safety-net settings and could play a pivotal role in achieving  improved population BP control and reducing hypertension disparities.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether walking is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease hospitalization and  death in community-dwelling older men and women. DESIGN: A prospective study,  with follow-up time of 4 to 5 years (average 4.2 years). SETTING: A western  Washington health maintenance organization. PARTICIPANTS: Men and women aged 65  years and older from a random sample of HMO enrollees invited by mail to  participate in a health promotion intervention trial (36% accepted the invitation  and completed questionnaires). This report is based on 1645 older adults without  severe disability and without history of heart disease. Vital status  ascertainment was complete (100%), and only 2.6% did not complete the follow-up.  MEASUREMENTS: Reported frequency and duration of walking for exercise, work,  errands, pleasure, and hiking in the 2 weeks before baseline were used to  classify hours of walking per week. The two main outcomes were: (1)  cardiovascular disease hospitalizations with a discharge diagnosis of coronary  (ICD-9-CM 410-414) or other cardiovascular diseases (ICD-9-CM 390-409, 415-448)  documented by computerized hospitalization records and (2) death. Numerous  potential confounding factors were considered, including age, sex, treated high  blood pressure, current estrogen use and chronic disease score (ascertained by  computerized medical and pharmacy records), and ethnicity, education, income,  physical function, self-rated health status, smoking, alcohol intake, and body  mass index (ascertained by self-report on the mailed questionnaire). RESULTS:  Walking more than 4 hours/week was associated significantly with a reduced risk  of cardiovascular disease hospitalization in both sexes combined compared with  walking less than 1 hour/week (age and sex-adjusted relative risk = 0.69; 95%  confidence interval, 0.52-0.90). This association was not altered by adjustment  for baseline cardiovascular risk factors and indicators of general health status.  The association was present in all age groups, among those with and without  physical limitations, and also among those who did and did not also participate  in more vigorous physical activities. Walking more than 4 hours/week was also  associated with a reduced risk of death (age and sex-adjusted relative risk =  0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-1.10), however, this association was  substantially diminished by adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and  measures of general health status. CONCLUSIONS: Walking more than 4 hours/week  may reduce the risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular disease events. The  association of walking more than 4 hours/week with reduced risk of death may be  mediated by effects of walking on other risk factors. These findings provide much  stronger evidence than previously available for advising older men and women to  embark on or maintain a sustained program of walking to prevent cardiovascular  disease events.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a diabetes education program that includes a pharmacist as a member of the diabetes management team by  assessing the change in hemoglobin A1c (A1C), cholesterol, and blood pressure for  patients with type 2 diabetes in outpatient clinics. METHODS: This was a  retrospective study in outpatient clinics at Shands Jacksonville Medical Center.  The patients were assigned into either the pharmacist group or the nonpharmacist  group, according to the presence or the absence of a pharmacist in the clinic.  The primary end point was the absolute change in A1C versus baseline. Secondary  end points included change in cholesterol and blood pressure and the number of  patients to attain American Diabetes Association goals. End points were recorded  to correlate within 3 months of the initial visit and final visit with a  provider. RESULTS: Compared to the nonpharmacist group, patients in the  pharmacist group had more advanced and uncontrolled diabetes at baseline. The  pharmacist group showed a greater percent change in A1C and improvement between  the initial and final clinic visits, after adjusting for baseline confounders.  Despite the statistically significant improvement in A1C in the pharmacist group,  there was no difference found between the 2 groups for the end points of  cholesterol and blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Including a pharmacist as a part of  the diabetes management team may result in lower A1C in patients with more  advanced and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus versus a health care team  without a pharmacist.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the current methods of medication therapy management (MTM) delivery have demonstrably improved therapeutic, safety, economic, and humanistic  health outcomes, patient- and prescriber-level barriers persist, limiting its  reach and effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To assess telephonic- and community-based  clinical pharmacy services in improving health indicators for rural, underserved  patients. METHODS: In 2014, an established MTM provider created a novel,  collaborative pilot program with independent retail and community health center  pharmacies to provide comprehensive, telephonic MTM services to rural Arizonans.  This pilot program used a combined telephonic- and community-based pharmacist  approach in the provision of MTM services for rural, underserved Arizona  populations. Adults with diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension, seen by a  prescriber or who filled prescriptions at a contracted, rural facility in 2014,  were eligible to participate. Initial MTM telephonic consultations were  conducted, and recommendations were communicated to patients' prescribers and/or  pharmacists. Patients received a follow-up telephone call at standard intervals,  depending on risk severity. RESULTS: A total of 517 patients participated, and  237 medication-related and 1,102 health promotion interventions were completed.  Positive trends were observed in fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose, and  diastolic blood pressure. Broad variation in prescriber acceptance of pharmacist  recommendations was observed (27%-60%). CONCLUSIONS: Study results provide  initial evidence to support the efficacy of collaborative efforts in the  provision of MTM services for improving health indicators and safety measures  while potentially reducing health care disparities. While the results are  encouraging, future research is warranted in more diverse populations and  settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite multiple treatment options, the prognosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains poor. PAH patients experience a high economic  burden due to comorbidities, hospitalizations, and medication costs. Although  combination therapy has been shown to reduce hospitalizations, the relationship  between treatment, health care utilization, and costs remains unclear. OBJECTIVE:  To provide a characterization of health care utilization and costs in real-world  settings by comparing periods before and after initiating PAH-specific treatment.  METHODS: This retrospective study identified PAH patients in the Truven Health  MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases between 2010 and 2014  who initiated treatment with endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs),  phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5Is), or soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)  stimulators. The index date was the date of the first PAH pharmacy claim. We  included patients with ≥ 2 medical claims with diagnoses for PAH (ICD-9-CM:  416.0, 416.8) or PAH-related conditions and continuous enrollment in medical and  pharmacy benefits for the 6 months before and after the index date. Treatment  patterns were assessed at the drug class level (ERAs, PDE-5Is, sGC stimulators,  and prostacyclins) from outpatient pharmacy claims during the 6-month post-index  period. All-cause and PAH-related utilization and costs were measured. McNemar's  and paired t-tests were used to compare patients' health care resource  utilization and costs in the 6-month pre- and posttreatment periods. RESULTS: A  total of 3,908 patients met the selection criteria. The study sample was 63%  female with a mean age of 63 ± 15 years. Only 5% of patients began initial  combination therapy for PAH, defined as claims for ≥ 2 medication classes within  the first 30 days of treatment. Treatment interruption (≥ 30-day gap in days  supply) of any PAH-specific medication was observed in 38% of patients. Compared  with the 6-month pre-index period, the proportion of patients in the 6-month  post-index period with any inpatient admission decreased, 42% versus 30% (P <  0.001). In addition, PAH-related inpatient admissions decreased in the 6-month  post-index period from 7% to 3% (P < 0.001). After treatment initiation,  patients' nonpharmacy medical costs decreased from $48,200 (SD = $117,686) to  $33,962 (SD = $90,294; P < 0.001), mainly attributable to reduced inpatient  costs. However, total average medical costs including pharmacy costs remained  comparable after treatment initiation (pre-index period = $51,455 vs. post-index  period = $53,923; P = 0.213). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that while patients'  PAH-related pharmacy costs increased after treatment initiation, the increase was  offset by reduced inpatient utilization; therefore, total health care costs  remained constant. While the majority of patients in this study were treated with  monotherapy, the recently completed AMBITION study indicated that initial  combination therapy with ambrisentan plus tadalafil reduced PAH-related  hospitalizations compared with initial monotherapy with either of these agents.  Future cost analyses of patients treated with combination therapy will be  required to determine the economic effect of initial combination therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the most important and often overlooked challenges for accountable care organizations (ACOs) is ensuring the optimal use of  pharmaceuticals, which can be accomplished by utilizing pharmacists' skillsets  and leveraging their full clinical expertise. Developing capabilities that  support, monitor, and ensure appropriate medication use, efficacy, and safety is  critical to achieving optimal patient outcomes and, ultimately, to an ACO's  success. The program described in this article highlights the best practices of  Fairview Pharmacy Services' Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program with  additional thoughts and considerations on this and similar MTM programs provided  by The Working Group on Optimizing Medication Therapy in Value-Based Healthcare.  PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Fairview Pharmacy Services utilizes 23 MTM pharmacists  (approximately 18 full-time equivalents) working in 30 locations, who conduct  pharmacotherapy workups as part of the MTM services that Fairview provides.  Pharmacists focus on patients in a comprehensive manner and assess all of their  diseases and medications. Responsibilities include (a) identification of a  patient's drug-related needs with a commitment to meet those needs; (b) an  assessment and confirmation that all of a patient's drug therapy is appropriately  indicated, effective and safe, and that the patient is compliant; (c) achievement  of therapy outcomes and ensuring documentation of those outcomes; and (d)  collaboration with all members of a patient's care team. OBSERVATIONS: Since  1998, pharmacists have cared for more than 20,000 patients and resolved more than  107,000 medication-related problems which, if left unresolved, could have led to  hospital readmissions and emergency visits. Since becoming a Pioneer ACO,  Fairview pharmacists have focused on the highest-risk members and have seen over  670 ACO patients, resolving over 2,780 medication-related problems. In terms of  clinical outcomes, MTM contributed to optimal care in complex patients with  diabetes. A review of 2007 data found that the percentage of diabetes patients  optimally managed (as measured by a composite of hemoglobin A1c, low-density  lipoprotein, blood pressure, aspirin use, and no smoking) was significantly  higher for MTM patients (21% vs. 45%, P < 0.01). The Fairview MTM also showed a  12:1 return on investment (ROI) when comparing the overall health care costs of  patients receiving MTM services with patients who did not receive those services.  IMPLICATIONS: Developing an MTM program to manage and optimize pharmaceuticals  will be a cornerstone to managing the health of a population. Important lessons  have been learned that may be helpful to other health systems developing MTM  programs. In an accountable care environment measuring the return on the  investment of all care interventions, including MTM will be essential to maintain  the program. The ACO will also have to be able to correctly identify which  patients are candidates for MTM services and provide pharmacists with enough  autonomy, including scheduling face-to-face interactions with patients and the  ability to change prescriptions if necessary, to ensure that timely and effective  care is delivered. In order for an ACO to deliver high quality patient-centered  medication services, there must be clear lines of communication between  providers, pharmacists, and the other care providers within the organization.  Finally, a strong and visionary leader is critical to ensuring the success of an  MTM program and ultimately the ACO itself. RECOMMENDATIONS: While there is a  plethora of literature touting the benefits of either in-person or  telephonic-based MTM, there is little research to date that directly compares  these 2 MTM delivery types. It is critical for research to address the direct and  indirect costs associated with starting and maintaining an MTM program.  Information such as technologies required to start a program and length of time  until a program breaks even or meets a sufficient ROI can be helpful for health  care providers in similar health systems pitching a similar type of program.  Finally, there has yet to be significant empirical research into the cost savings  of utilizing a pharmacist and MTM services associated with meeting quality and  cost benchmarks in an accountable care payment arrangement.

AB  - During a decade various actions have been taken to decrease the use of inappropriate medication for elderly patients in Sweden. The Swedish Health  Department has recently compiled guidelines for inappropriate medication that can  be used to evaluate medication in nursing homes for elderly. At the beginning of  our project we assessed the medication of persons living in 21 nursing homes in  the northeastern district of the county Skåne and based on this analysis we  decided that one of the actions to take were drug-reviews. For a period of two  years an intensified effort was made to improve medical treatment in nursing  homes in the district. Seventeen nursing homes, with 181 patients, were willing  to participate. The patients' current medications, state of health (including  blood pressure and weight) and known diagnosis were evaluated by a pharmacist and  a geriatrician. A specific written recommendation on how to modify drug-usage in  these patients were sent to the nursing homes. Decisions were then made by the  doctors in charge of the patients on which adjustments to make. At the end of the  project 127 patients were reevaluated concerning quality and quantity of  medication. A comparison was made before and after the drug-review. Positive  results were obtained as well as a lower drug cost. An assessment of the  patients' state of health, before and after drug-review, showed a tendency  towards improvement. We compared our results with those of a Swedish project that  used a different method of drug-review with a visiting pharmacist instead of a  written recommendation. The changes in the patients' medication before and after  drug-review were the same.

AB  - Systematic approaches for compliance problem detection and intervention are needed if the benefits of prescribed drug therapy in chronic disease management  are to be optimized. As with all measures of compliance, computer algorithms  based on refill patterns have advantages and disadvantages. They are unobtrusive  and easily determined, but they measure the timeliness of prescription refills,  not actual drug-taking. Computer-generated algorithms for assessing compliance  based on refill patterns should be used by practitioners with caution, because  they are not only markers for potential drug taking compliance problems, but also  for discrepancies between the medical chart, pharmacy records and verbal advice  given to the patient. Because patients may obtain refills before depleting their  supply, compliance rates using this methodology are best determined across  several refills. In particular, we urge caution in applying them over time  periods of less than 60 days. Longer minimum time periods further decrease the  likelihood of "false positives" but limit the number of patients for whom a  compliance measure can be computed. For the health professional (eg, the  pharmacist) responsible for monitoring drug-taking compliance of patients, the  message seems clear: when reviewing computer-generated noncompliance "flags," the  first task is to fully explore the possibility of discrepancies in drug records  before initiating compliance-related interventions.

AB  - Hypertension and diabetes are overrepresented in the African-American population and can be particularly devastating in this population. These diseases share  genetic predisposition, medical risk factors, and environmental influences as  etiologic factors, and they may be interrelated, at least in part, by obesity and  accompanying hyperinsulinemia. Noncompliance with treatment plans is a  significant barrier to health improvement in both diseases, but increased  attention to patient involvement in care is a potential solution to this  long-standing problem. The Baltimore Alliance for the Prevention and Control of  Hypertension and Diabetes was established in January 1998 to promote care to the  underserved community of West Baltimore, Maryland, and to improve outcomes of  hypertension and diabetes. Based at the University of Maryland School of  Medicine, the Baltimore Alliance comprises a community health worker program, a  church-based education and screening effort, managed care and pharmaceutical  company (Hoechst Marion Roussel) partners, a health policy and services research  group, and inpatient/outpatient clinical care sites in the health system.  Mobilization, cultural relevance, and partnership are employed to ensure that the  Alliance's goals of increased patient enrollment and retention in treatment  programs will be achieved. Thereby, improved outcomes--clinical, humanistic, and  economic--will result. Novel as well as classic approaches to patient education,  compliance, and goal achievement are being pursued. Complete expert systems for  hypertension and diabetes disease management are being created and will be  implemented in the near future. Baseline practices and current outcomes are being  identified to act as historical controls. The organization and administration of  the Alliance will serve as a prototype that others may follow.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Only half of hypertensive adults achieve blood pressure (BP) control in the United States, and it is unclear how BP control rates may be improved most  effectively and efficiently at the population level. OBJECTIVE: We sought to  compare the potential effects of system-wide isolated improvements in medication  adherence, visit frequency, and higher physician prescription rate on achieving  BP control at 52 weeks. DESIGN: We developed a Markov microsimulation model of  patient-level, physician-level, and system-level processes involved in  controlling hypertension with medications. The model is informed by data from  national surveys, cohort studies and trials, and was validated against two  multicenter clinical trials (ALLHAT and VALUE). SUBJECTS: We studied a simulated,  nationally representative cohort of patients with diagnosed but uncontrolled  hypertension with a usual source of care. INTERVENTIONS: We simulated a base case  and improvements of 10 and 50%, and an ideal scenario for three modifiable  parameters: visit frequency, treatment intensification, and medication adherence.  Ideal scenarios were defined as 100% for treatment intensification and adherence,  and return visits occurring within 4 weeks of an elevated office systolic BP.  MAIN OUTCOME: BP control at 52 weeks of follow-up was examined. RESULTS: Among  25,000 hypothetical adult patients with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic BP ≥  140 mmHg), only 18% achieved BP control after 52 weeks using base-case  assumptions. With 10/50%/idealized enhancements in each isolated parameter,  enhanced treatment intensification achieved the greatest BP control (19/23/71%),  compared with enhanced visit frequency (19/21/35%) and medication adherence  (19/23/26%). When all three processes were idealized, the model predicted a BP  control rate of 95% at 52 weeks. CONCLUSION: Substantial improvements in BP  control can only be achieved through major improvements in processes of care.  Healthcare systems may achieve greater success by increasing the frequency of  clinical encounters and improving physicians' prescribing behavior than by  attempting to improve patient adherence to medications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied whether care management is a pragmatic solution for improving population blood pressure (BP) control and addressing BP disparities  between Blacks and Whites in routine clinical environments. DESIGN:  Quasi-experimental, observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 3,964  uncontrolled hypertensive patients receiving primary care within the last year  from one of six Baltimore clinics were identified as eligible. INTERVENTION:  Three in-person sessions over three months with registered dietitians and  pharmacists who addressed medication titration, patient adherence to healthy  behaviors and medication, and disparities-related barriers. MAIN MEASURES: We  assessed the population impact of care management using the RE-AIM framework. To  evaluate effectiveness in improving BP, we used unadjusted, adjusted, and  propensity-score matched differences-in-differences models to compare those who  completed all sessions with partial completers and non-participants. RESULTS: Of  all eligible patients, 5% participated in care management. Of 629 patients who  entered care management, 245 (39%) completed all three sessions. Those completing  all sessions on average reached BP control (mean BP 137/78) and experienced 9 mm  Hg systolic blood pressure (P<.001) and 4 mm Hg DBP (P=.004) greater improvement  than non-participants; findings did not vary in adjusted or propensity-score  matched models. Disparities in systolic and diastolic BP between Blacks and  Whites were not detectable at completion. CONCLUSIONS: It may be possible to  achieve BP control among both Black and White patients who participate in a few  sessions of care management. However, the very limited reach and patient  challenges with program completion should raise significant caution with relying  on care management alone to improve population BP control and eliminate related  disparities.

AB  - PURPOSE: Recently, there has been dramatic increase in the diagnosis and pharmaceutical management of common chronic illnesses. Using qualitative data  collected in primary care clinics, we assessed how these trends play out in  clinical care. METHODS: This qualitative study focused on management of type 2  diabetes and hypertension in 44 primary care clinics in Michigan and was based on  interviews with 58 clinicians and 70 of their patients, and observations of 107  clinical consultations. We assessed clinicians' treatment strategies and  discussions of factors influencing treatment decisions, and patients'  understandings and experiences in managing these illnesses. RESULTS: Clinicians  focused on helping patients achieve test results recommended by national  guidelines, and most reported combining 2 or more medications per condition to  reach targets. Medication selection and management was the central focus of the  consultations we observed. Polypharmacy was common among patients, with more than  one-half taking 5 or more medications. Patient interviews indicated that heavy  reliance on pharmaceuticals presents challenges to patient well-being, including  financial costs and experiences of adverse health effects. CONCLUSIONS: Factors  promoting heavy use of pharmaceuticals include lower diagnostic and treatment  thresholds, clinician-auditing and reward systems, and the prescribing cascade,  whereby more medications are prescribed to control the effects of  already-prescribed medications. We present a conceptual model, the inverse  benefit law, to provide insight into the impact of pharmaceutical marketing  efforts on the observed trends. We make recommendations about limiting the  influence of the pharmaceutical industry on clinical practice, toward improving  the well-being of patients with chronic illness.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of patient, provider, and systems interventions (Key Question [KQ] 1) or policy interventions (KQ 2) in improving  medication adherence for an array of chronic health conditions. For interventions  that are effective in improving adherence, we then assessed their effectiveness  in improving health, health care utilization, and adverse events. DATA SOURCES:  MEDLINE®, the Cochrane Library. Additional studies were identified from reference  lists and technical experts. REVIEW METHODS: Two people independently selected,  extracted data from, and rated the risk of bias of relevant trials and systematic  reviews. We synthesized the evidence for effectiveness separately for each  clinical condition, and within each condition, by type of intervention. We also  evaluated the prevalence of intervention components across clinical conditions  and the effectiveness of interventions for a range of vulnerable populations. Two  reviewers graded the strength of evidence using established criteria. RESULTS: We  found a total of 62 eligible studies (58 trials and 4 observational studies) from  our review of 3,979 abstracts. These studies included patients with diabetes,  hyperlipidemia, hypertension, heart failure, myocardial infarction, asthma,  depression, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, musculoskeletal diseases, and multiple  chronic conditions. Fifty-seven trials of patient, provider, or systems  interventions (KQ 1) evaluated 20 different types of interventions; 4  observational studies and one trial of policy interventions (KQ 2) evaluated the  effect of reduced out-of-pocket expenses or improved prescription drug coverage.  We found the most consistent evidence of improvement in medication adherence for  interventions to reduce out-of-pocket expenses or improve prescription drug  coverage, case management, and educational interventions across clinical  conditions. Within clinical conditions, we found the strongest support for  self-management of medications for short-term improvement in adherence for asthma  patients; collaborative care or case management programs for short-term  improvement of adherence and to improve symptoms for patients taking depression  medications; and pharmacist-led approaches for hypertensive patients to improve  systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse interventions offer promising  approaches to improving medication adherence for chronic conditions, particularly  for the short term. Evidence on whether these approaches have broad applicability  for clinical conditions and populations is limited, as is evidence regarding  long-term medication adherence or health outcomes.

AB  - The authors evaluated maintenance of achieved cardiovascular risk control after discharge from a pharmacist-coordinated cardiovascular risk reduction clinic.  Using data from 2001 to 2004 divided by financial quarters (ie, 3-month periods),  the authors performed survival analysis of diabetic patients who had attained at  least one cardiovascular risk goal in the clinic. Mean times to failure were 7.1  +/- 0.21 quarters for hemoglobin A1c, 7.6 +/- 0.29 quarters for low-density  lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and 2.5 +/- 0.24 quarters for systolic blood  pressure (SBP). Body mass index predicted glycemic control failure (hazard ratio  [HR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.15; P = .02), insulin use  predicted LDL-C control failure (HR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.15-8.22; P = .03), and  baseline SBP predicted SBP control failure (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01-1.03; P =  .0003). The authors found good durability of effect for most cardiovascular risk  targets. Worse control at entry predicted failure after successful attainment of  a cardiovascular goal. More sustained attention or booster interventions for  patients with worse control at entry may be necessary.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary open angle glaucoma is a chronic, progressive eye disease that is the leading cause of blindness among African Americans. Glaucoma  progresses more rapidly and appears about 10 years earlier in African Americans  as compared to whites. African Americans are also less likely to receive  comprehensive eye care when glaucoma could be detected before irreversible  blindness. Screening and follow-up protocols for managing glaucoma recommended by  eye-care professional organizations are often not followed by primary eye-care  providers, both ophthalmologists and optometrists. There is a pressing need to  improve both the accessibility and quality of glaucoma care for African  Americans. Telemedicine may be an effective solution for improving management and  diagnosis of glaucoma because it depends on ocular imaging and tests that can be  electronically transmitted to remote reading centers where tertiary care  specialists can examine the results. We describe the Eye Care Quality and  Accessibility Improvement in the Community project (EQUALITY), set to evaluate a  teleglaucoma program deployed in retail-based primary eye care practices serving  communities with a large percentage of African Americans. METHODS/DESIGN: We  conducted an observational, 1-year prospective study based in two Walmart Vision  Centers in Alabama staffed by primary care optometrists. EQUALITY focuses on new  or existing adult patients who are at-risk for glaucoma or already diagnosed with  glaucoma. Patients receive dilated comprehensive examinations and diagnostic  testing for glaucoma, followed by the optometrist's diagnosis and a preliminary  management plan. Results are transmitted to a glaucoma reading center where  ophthalmologists who completed fellowship training in glaucoma review results and  provide feedback to the optometrist, who manages the care of the patient.  Patients also receive eye health education about glaucoma and comprehensive eye  care. Research questions include diagnostic and management agreement between  providers, the impact of eye health education on patients' knowledge and  adherence to follow-up and medication, patient satisfaction, program  cost-effectiveness, and EQUALITY's impact on Walmart pharmacy prescription rates.  DISCUSSION: As eye-care delivery systems in the US strive to improve quality  while reducing costs, telemedicine programs including teleglaucoma initiatives  such as EQUALITY could contribute toward reaching this goal, particularly among  underserved populations at-risk for chronic blinding diseases.

T2  - Hawaii medical journal
AB  - PURPOSE: Practice patterns were investigated for an insured population to determine if prescribing patterns, switching, and relative adherence by drug  class for first-line antihypertensive medications adhered to national guidelines.  PROCEDURES: Drug use was obtained from pharmaceutical claims. Prescriptions were  categorized into 6 drug classes for analyses. Adherence with antihypertensive  medications was based on a medication possession ratio or 0.8 or greater. For the  analyses, 28,073 patients were categorized into groups: hypertension alone,  hypertension plus diabetes, and hypertension plus congestive heart failure.  Patient and physician characteristics affecting prescribing, switching, and  adherence were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis.  FINDINGS: Thiazide diuretics were used and adhered to less often, despite  national guideline recommendations. New drug classes were used more highly.  CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistency exists between guidelines and practice as older,  cheaper drugs were used less and more expensive drugs were used more often with  better adherence.

AB  - This study evaluated the impact of a clinical pharmacy service on the cost of antihypertensive drug therapy in an HMO family practice clinic. The service was  provided to five family practice physicians. Pharmacists identified hypertensive  patients prior to their regularly scheduled office visits from April through June  1986. Patient's medical records and computerized drug files were reviewed, and  written recommendations for drug therapy changes were placed in patients' medical  record by the pharmacists. When appropriate, pharmacists alerted prescribers to  lower cost alternatives. A matched control group of physicians was selected.  Hypertensive patients were identified retrospectively in the control group. We  found that the cost of antihypertensive drug therapy was significantly higher for  study physicians' patients when compared with control physicians' patients in the  period prior to implementing the service. The difference between the two groups  was not significant after six months. Clinical pharmacist intervention decreased  the average cost of antihypertensive treatment from 33.4 to 27.2 cents per day.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A worsening of blood pressure control has occurred in the 1990s despite the availability of sophisticated technologic, pharmacologic, and  educational advances applicable to hypertension care. Clinical guidelines that  are intended to improve hypertension care by making specific recommendations on  drug use, frequency of follow-up care, and target levels of blood pressure have  been developed. METHODS: The Institute for Clinical Systems Integration's  (ICSI's; Minneapolis) Hypertension Treatment Guideline was developed in 1994 and  is updated annually. This study employed a quasi-experimental, before-and-after  design at two medical groups to assess changes in the care provided to patients  18 years of age and older with identified hypertension (International  Classification of Diseases-9 codes 401.0, 401.1, or 401.9). RESULTS: Among adults  with hypertension, the proportion meeting the blood pressure goal of < 140/90 mm  Hg increased from 36.8% (of 685 patients) preguideline to 50.3% (of 928 patients)  postguideline (chi-square = 29.4, p < 0.001); the mean arterial pressure  decreased from 102.7 mm Hg to 99.4 mm Hg (t = 5.45, p < 0.001). Cohort analysis  of patients enrolled at both points in time confirmed these findings and showed  an increase in the number of office visits from 5.4 to 6.7 visits per patient per  year after guideline implementation (F = 10.9, p = 0.001). The use of a  guideline-recommended medication for treatment of blood pressure was 35.9%  preguideline and 36.2% postguideline. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a  hypertension treatment guideline in primary care clinics was related to  significantly improved hypertension control. Identification, tracking, and active  outreach to patients with hypertension were used by all clinics.

AB  - Many underserved patients in Utah lack insurance coverage for health care and prescription drugs but are provided medical care in community health centers  (CHCs). Before June 2000, comprehensive pharmacy services were not provided to  these patients at a Utah CHC. As part of a Health Resources and Services  Administration grant, a collaborative agreement between the University of Utah  College of Pharmacy and Utah CHCs was established so that a faculty clinician who  is a certified diabetes educator (CDE) could provide diabetes education and care  to underserved patients. The College of Pharmacy faculty clinician (pharmacist  CDE) collaborated with physicians and midlevel practitioners to provide diabetes  education and care for 176 patients. In addition to initial diabetes education,  the pharmacist CDE provided continuing disease management by providing  information and feedback to patients and recommendations to providers. The  pharmacist CDE conducted continuing chart reviews to track certain parameters,  such as laboratory test results for hemoglobin A 1c (A1C) and lipid levels, and  blood pressure. Patients were followed for 1-3 years. The same outcome data were  also collected for 176 patients with diabetes mellitus in another CHC clinic to  provide a comparison group. Total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, A1C, and triglyceride levels declined significantly from baseline at  both sites. However, more patients who were provided care by the pharmacist CDE  reached the American Diabetes Association A1C target goal of below 7%.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess antihypertensive treatment practices and outcomes for patients with acute severe hypertension requiring hospitalization. DESIGN:  Subanalysis of a multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study. DATA SOURCE:  The STAT registry (data from 25 hospitals). PATIENTS: A total of 1184 consecutive  adults with acute severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 180 mm Hg,  diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg), without a neurologic reason for admission,  receiving two or more intermittent intravenous antihypertensive doses or a  continuous intravenous infusion within 24 hours of hospitalization. MEASUREMENTS  AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients started intravenous antihypertensive therapy 1.3  (median [interquartile range (IQR) 0.5-3.2]) hours after the qualifying SBP  (median 204 [IQR 190-221] mm Hg). Labetalol (27%), metoprolol (21%), and  nitroglycerin (20%) were the most frequent initial intravenous choices. For the  43% of patients administered two or more intravenous agents sequentially, the 24%  receiving three or more, and the 8% receiving four or more, median SBPs at the  time of the second, third, and fourth additions were 186 (IQR 168-211), 176 (IQR  152-196), and 164 (IQR 143-193) mm Hg, respectively. Most common continuous  intravenous infusions were nitroglycerin (30%), nicardipine (13%), and labetalol  (7%). After the first intravenous agent, an SBP decrease of 10-25% was achieved  at 1 and 6 hours in 48% and 72%, respectively. Of the 6% without at least a 10%  decrease in SBP during the entire hospitalization, labetalol (28%), hydralazine  (21%), and metoprolol (17%) were the most frequent initial intravenous choices.  Hypotension (SBP ≤ 90 mm Hg) occurred in 5% and was most common with intravenous  nitroglycerin (39%). Oral antihypertensives were started within 1 and 6 hours  after the first intravenous therapy in 13% and 34% of patients, respectively,  with many patients (61%) receiving three or more oral agents during  hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Pharmacologic treatment of acute severe hypertension  in patients with nonneurologic causes is heterogeneous and often not consistent  with Joint National Committee recommendations. Patients received numerous  intravenous agents, experienced variable decreases in SBP, often failed to  receive timely oral therapy, and a clinically relevant proportion developed  hypotension.

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Two  primary care clinics in the Seattle, Washington, area. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one  PCPs and 874 patients aged 75 and older. INTERVENTION: An interdisciplinary team  of geriatrics specialists worked with patients and providers to enhance the  geriatric focus of care. MEASUREMENTS: Main outcomes were a practice style  reflecting a geriatric orientation and patient scores on the physical and affect  subscales of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2-Short Form. Secondary  outcomes were hospitalizations, incident disability in activities of daily living  (ADLs), and PCP perceptions of the intervention. Death rates were also assessed.  RESULTS: Intervention providers screened significantly more for geriatric  syndromes at 12 months, but this finding did not persist at 24 months. There were  no significant differences in adequate hypertension control or high-risk  prescribing at 12 or 24 months of follow-up. There were no significant  differences in patient functioning or significant differences in hospitalization  rates at either time point. Meaningful differences were observed in ADL  disability at 12 but not 24 months. PCPs viewed the intervention favorably.  Seventy-eight participants died over the 24 months of follow-up; the proportion  dying was higher in the intervention group (11.4% in intervention group vs 7.1%  of controls, P=.03). CONCLUSION: The addition of an interdisciplinary geriatric  team was acceptable to PCPs and had some effect on care of geriatric conditions  but little effect on patient function or the use of inpatient care and was  associated with greater mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study compared the clinical characteristics, use of guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy, and outcomes of patients diagnosed as  having bipolar disorder who were exclusively seen in Department of Veteran  Affairs (VA) primary care settings with those of patients with bipolar disorder  who received any VA mental health services. METHODS: Data from the 1999 Large  Health Survey of Veterans were linked to VA data from the National Psychosis  Registry to identify patients diagnosed as having bipolar disorder (N=14,643).  Multivariable analyses adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and  clinical and severity factors determined whether exclusive primary care use  versus any mental health care use was associated with poor clinical and services  outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 7.6% used primary care services exclusively. Compared  with persons who used specialty care services, those who used primary care  exclusively were more likely to be diagnosed as having cardiovascular disease  (odds ratio [OR]=1.26, p<.05) or hypertension (OR=1.31, p<.01), less likely to  receive guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy (OR=.18, p<.001), more likely to  have an inpatient medical visit (OR=1.36, p<.01), and less likely to have an  inpatient psychiatric visit (OR=.36, p<.001). Persons who received only primary  care were more likely to have worse physical health and better mental health, as  measured by the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with  bipolar disorder treated in primary care settings were more likely than those who  received some care in a mental health specialty setting to have comorbid general  medical disorders. Optimal care settings for patients with bipolar disorder may  require strategies that address gaps in general medical as well as psychiatric  care.

T2  - The Annals of pharmacotherapy
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare compliance rates associated with categories of antihypertensive medications in a Veteran's Affairs (VA) Healthcare System by use  of readily available data and standard software. METHODS: Prescriptions from the  Veteran's Health Information System Technology Architecture (VISTA) database for  angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers  (ARBs), beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers (CCBs), diuretics, and a  miscellaneous group of antihypertensives filled or refilled during a 12-month  period were included in the analysis. Claims data for each prescription were  exported from the VISTA database to Microsoft Excel, and compliance rates were  calculated by use of a methodology reported elsewhere. Mean compliance rates for  each antihypertensive category were compared. RESULTS: A total of 26 201  prescription records accounting for 51 927 separate prescription fills or refills  were included. The majority of prescriptions (77%) were associated with  calculated compliance rates >80%. The CCB category was associated with a  significantly higher compliance rate (p < 0.001) than the beta-blockers (95% CI  1.3% to 3.7%), diuretics (95% CI 1.4% to 3.8%), and miscellaneous agents (95% CI  1.7% to 7.5%). The ACE inhibitor category was associated with a significantly  higher rate (p < 0.001) than the beta-blockers (95% CI 0.7% to 3.0%), diuretics  (95% CI 0.7% to 3.0%), and miscellaneous agents (95% CI 1.1% to 6.8%). The ARB  category had a higher compliance rate (p < 0.001) than the miscellaneous category  (95% CI 1.2% to 11.9%). There were no significant differences in compliance rates  among ACE inhibitors, CCBs, or ARBs. CONCLUSIONS: VA outpatients are relatively  compliant when taking their antihypertensive medications as measured by  prescription refill rates. Compliance rates for CCBs and ACE inhibitors are  higher than those for beta-blockers, diuretics, and agents such as clonidine,  methyldopa, hydralazine, and reserpine. Compliance for ARBs compared favorably  with those of CCBs and ACE inhibitors. The methods used in this evaluation can be  easily implemented at other institutions as part of ongoing medication compliance  improvement efforts.

T2  - Medical care
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines emphasize the need to assess and treat overall risk for cardiovascular disease through the concomitant management of multiple risk  factors. We sought to ascertain treatment patterns and attainment of therapeutic  goals in patients with isolated and concomitant hypertension and dyslipidemia,  both with and without diabetes mellitus (DM) and symptomatic cardiovascular  disease. METHODS: Inception cohorts of more than 41,000 newly diagnosed  hypertension and dyslipidemia patients from 6 medical centers of the  south-central Veterans Affairs health care system were evaluated. Treatment  patterns and goal attainment for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C;  Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on  Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults  guidelines: <160, <130, or <or=100 mg/dL depending on risk factors) and blood  pressure (BP; Joint National Committee 6: <140/90 or <130/85 mm Hg depending on  risk factors) were measured at 1 year. Separate analyses were conducted in  patients with and without DM and symptomatic cardiovascular disease. RESULTS:  Treatment rates in patients with and without DM and symptomatic disease ranged  from 46.6% to 71.3% in patients with hypertension only, from 31.5% to 64.1% in  patients with dyslipidemia only, and from 64.3% to 91.3% in patients with both  conditions. Among asymptomatic patients, 40.6% of nondiabetics and 20.6% of  patients with DM with isolated hypertension reached BP targets. Attainment of  LDL-C goals was slightly higher and reached 52.8% among patients with DM with  concomitant hypertension. Among symptomatic patients, attainment of all goals was  <40% for all groups. The proportion of asymptomatic patients with concomitant  disease reaching goal for both BP and LDL-C was 24.4% among nondiabetics and  15.4% among patients with DM; these proportions decreased to 13.6% and 13.4%  respectively, among patients with symptomatic cardiovascular disease.  CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients were receiving pharmacological treatment of  hypertension and dyslipidemia, yet attainment of therapeutic goals was generally  <50%. Further work is needed to determine factors related to improvement in  management and outcomes of patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors.

T2  - Journal of the Mississippi State Medical Association
AB  - Health research conducted over the past 15 years in the Mississippi Delta has continually documented a population experiencing poor health status (high rates  of chronic diseases and excessive related mortalities). Both individual and  health system resources are scarce in this region, posing barriers to effective  chronic disease management. Two of the most significant chronic diseases that  burden this population are hypertension and diabetes. To address this issue, the  Delta Community Partners In Care project centering on chronic disease control was  developed by a consortium of local health care institutions and supported by a  national foundation. The intervention model centers on the utilization of a  community-based case management approach in 13 clinical sites. Both compliance to  pharmacological and individualized nonpharmacological therapy and continuity of  care are stressed. A number of outcome measures showed significant improvement  over the 24 month project period (N = 756).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medication adherence, defined as taking medications as prescribed, is a key component in controlling disease progression and managing chronic illnesses  such as diabetes, hypertension, and high blood cholesterol. These diseases  constitute 3 of the top 5 most prevalent conditions among Medicare beneficiaries,  warranting further attention to find ways to promote better medication adherence.  The scientific literature has established the clinical and financial benefits of  medication adherence and the role of dispensing channel in impacting adherence to  medications. However, a common limitation in channel-adherence studies is the  failure to control for healthy adherer effect (HAE), referring to individuals who  are likely to engage proactively in activities that improve their adherence.  Healthier individuals may choose the home-delivery channel to ensure continuity  in their medication regimens and to minimize obstacles to adherence, such as  inadequate access, inconvenience, and financial concerns. Thus, better medication  adherence in home delivery may reflect healthier patients' predisposition to  self-select for home delivery options. To accurately attribute the impact of  dispensing channel on adherence, research would need to control for bias from a  patient's predisposition to be adherent.  OBJECTIVE: To examine the association  of pharmacy dispensing channel (home delivery or retail pharmacy) with medication  adherence for Medicare Part D beneficiaries taking medications for diabetes,  hypertension, or high blood cholesterol, while controlling for low-income subsidy  status, differences in days supply, and prior adherence behavior (PAB) as a way  to partly control for HAE. METHODS: A retrospective analysis using de-identified  pharmacy claims data from a large national pharmacy benefits manager between  October 2010 and December 2012. Continuously eligible Medicare Part D  beneficiaries (Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans participants only)  aged 65 years or older who had an antidiabetic, antihypertensive, or  antihyperlipidemic prescription claim between October and December 2010, were  identified and followed for the next 2 years. Those enrolled in a home delivery  auto refill program were excluded from this analysis. Multivariate logistic  regression was used to evaluate the impact of dispensing channel on medication  adherence, controlling for differences in demographics, low-income subsidy  status, disease burden, and drug-use pattern. Patients with a proportion of days  covered of ≥ 80% were considered to be adherent. The analysis controlled for PAB  by using patients' adherence status in the year 2011.  RESULTS: The final  analytical samples consisted of 150,389 diabetic patients, 615,618 hypertension  patients, and 358,795 high blood cholesterol patients. The adjusted odds of being  adherent for beneficiaries using home delivery were 1.25 times higher  (CI = 1.20-1.30) for diabetes medications, 1.29 times higher (CI = 1.27-1.32) for  hypertension medications, and 1.26 times higher (CI = 1.23-1.29) for high blood  cholesterol medications, compared with beneficiaries using retail channels to  obtain their prescriptions. PAB was the strongest contributor to the odds of a  patient being adherent across all 3 therapy classes, ranging from odds ratio of  4.48 to 8.09.  CONCLUSIONS: After excluding patients who received any  prescriptions via home delivery auto refill programs and controlling for PAB,  differences in days supply, low-income subsidy status, demographics, and disease  burden, Medicare beneficiaries who use home delivery for antidiabetics,  antihypertensives, or antihyperlipidemics have a greater likelihood of being  adherent than patients who fill their prescriptions at retail. The results of  this study provide evidence that where medications are received may impact  adherence, even when controlling for PAB. Use of the home delivery dispensing  channel may be an effective method to improve adherence for Medicare  beneficiaries.

T2  - Journal of managed care pharmacy : JMCP
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated in previous studies that pharmacist management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the outpatient  setting not only improves diabetes-related clinical outcomes such as hemoglobin  A1c but also blood pressure (BP), total cholesterol (TC), and quality of life.  Improved control of BP and TC has been shown to reduce the risks of  cardiovascular disease (CVD), which has placed a heavy economic burden on the  health care system. However, no study has evaluated the cost-effectiveness of  pharmacist intervention programs with respect to the long-term preventive effects  on CVD outcomes among T2DM patients. OBJECTIVES: To (a) quantify the long-term  preventive effects of pharmacist intervention on CVD outcomes among T2DM patients  using evidence from a matched cohort study in the outpatient primary care setting  and (b) assess the relative cost-effectiveness of adding a clinical pharmacist to  the primary care team for the management of patients with T2DM based on  improvement in CVD risks with the aid of an economic model. METHODS: Clinical  data between the periods of June 2007 to February 2010 were collected from  electronic medical records at 2 separate clinics at Kaiser Permanente (KP)  Northern California, 1 with primary care physicians only (control group) and the  other with the addition of a pharmacist (enhanced care group). Patients in the  enhanced care group were matched 1:1 with patients in the control group according  to baseline characteristics that included age, gender, A1c, and Charlson  comorbidity score. The estimated 10-year CVD risk for both groups was calculated  by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine (version 2)  based on age, sex, race, smoking status, atrial fibrillation, duration of  diabetes, levels of A1c, systolic BP (SBP) and TC, and high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (HDL-C) observed at 12 months. There was no statistical difference in  the baseline clinical inputs to the Risk Engine (A1c [P=0.115], SBP [P=0.184], TC  [P=0.055], and HDL-C [P=0.475]) between the 2 groups. A Markov model was  developed to simulate the estimated CVD outcomes over 10 years and to estimate  cost-effectiveness. The final outcomes examined included incremental cost and  effectiveness measured by life years and per quality-adjusted life year gained.  Both deterministic sensitivity analysis (SA) and probabilistic SA were conducted  to examine the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The estimated risks for  coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke (both nonfatal and fatal) at the end of  the follow-up were consistently lower in the enhanced care group compared with  the control group, even though baseline risks in both groups were similar. The  absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the enhanced care and control groups  increased over time. For example, the ARR for nonfatal CHD risk in year 1 was  0.5% (1.2% vs. 0.7%), whereas the ARR increased to 5.5% in year 10 (14.8% vs.  9.3%). Similarly, the ARR between the enhanced care and the control groups was  calculated as 0.3% for fatal CHD in year 1 and increased to 4.6% in year 10.  Results from the Markov model suggest that the enhanced care group was shown to  be a dominant strategy (less expensive and more effective) compared with the  control group in the 10-year evaluation period in the base-case (average or mean  results) scenario. Sensitivity analysis that took into account the uncertainty in  all important variables, such as wage of pharmacists, utility weight (the degree  of preference individuals have for a particular health state or condition),  response rate to pharmacists' care, and uncertainty associated with the estimated  10 years of CVD risk, revealed that the relative value of enhanced care was  robust to most of the variations in these parameters. Notably, the level of  cost-effectiveness measured by net monetary value depends on the time horizon  adopted by the payers and the magnitude of CVD risk reduction. The enhanced care  group has a higher chance of being considered as a cost-effective strategy when a  longer time horizon such as a minimum of 4 to 5 years is adopted. CONCLUSIONS:  Adding pharmacists to the health care management team for diabetic patients  improves the long-term CVD risks. The longer-term CVD risk reductions were shown  to be more dramatic than the short-term reduction. A longer time horizon adopted  by health plans in managing T2DM patients has a higher probability of making the  intervention cost-effective.

AB  - Treatment of hypertension among hospitalized patients represents an opportunity to improve blood pressure recognition and treatment. To address this issue, the  authors examined patterns of antihypertensive medication prescribing among 5668  hypertensive inpatients. Outcomes were treatment with any antihypertensive  medication and treatment with first-line therapy, defined as  angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, or  calcium channel blockers. Logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex,  race, length of stay, service line, and comorbidity were used for all  comparisons. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for treatment were higher for  men (1.4, P<.001), older patients (2.5 for age older than 80 vs 1.0 for age  younger than 40; P<.001), non-white race (1.2 vs 1.0 for white race; P<.004), and  generalist service line (1.4 vs 1.0 for all other services; P<.001).  Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for receiving first-line agents were higher for  older patients and generalist service line. Among surgical patients, receipt of  medical consultation was only marginally associated with higher odds of  antihypertensive or first-line treatment after adjustment for relevant clinical  variables. Demographic factors and service line appear to play a major role in  determining the likelihood of inpatient hypertension treatment. Understanding and  addressing these disparities has the potential to incrementally improve  hypertension control rates in the population.

T2  - Journal of managed care pharmacy : JMCP
AB  - BACKGROUND: The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers  (ARBs) in patients with diabetes and comorbid hypertension or renal disease.  OBJECTIVE: To examine the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in members of a Medicaid  managed care organization (MCO) with diabetes and a diagnosis of hypertension  and/or kidney disease to determine to what extent (1) physicians are conforming  to the recommended course of treatment according to ADA guidelines published in  2002 and still current and (2) patients are adhering to their prescribed therapy.  METHODS: Patients with diabetes were identified using medical claims from a  Medicaid MCO in Maryland of approximately 118,000 members continuously enrolled  during the study period. To be included in the cohort, members had to have at  least 1 medical claim containing a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus from April 1,  2001, through March 31, 2002, using the International Classification of Diseases,  Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code of 250.xx. Additional  medical claims during the same time period for hypertension, ICD-9- CM code  401.xx, and renal disease, ICD-9-CM codes for nephropathy (582.81 or 582.9),  proteinuria (791.0), or diabetic nephropathy (250.40 or 250.42 for type 2  diabetes only), were used to categorize the cohort into 4 subgroups: diabetes and  renal disease with hypertension, diabetes and renal disease without hypertension,  diabetes and hypertension without renal disease, and diabetes without renal  disease and without hypertension. Pharmacy claims for ACE inhibitors and ARBs  were obtained from July 1, 2001, through June 30, 2002, and utilization was  defined as the patient having at least 1 pharmacy claim for an ACE inhibitor or  an ARB. Patient adherence with ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy was measured using  medication possession ratio (MPR) and median gap between prescription refills.  RESULTS: There were 1,698 patients, approximately 2.3% of the total continuously  enrolled members, with 1 or more medical claims containing an ICD-9-CM code of  250.xx for diabetes mellitus. The average age was 48 13.2 years for the total  sample, and nearly 70% of the patients were women (1,188 women and 510 men). Only  13% of the patients in the sample had medical claim evidence of any renal  involvement, while 63% of the study patients had hypertension. A total of 915  patients (53.9%) had at least 1 pharmacy claim for an ACE inhibitor or an ARB,  accounting for 7,934 unique pharmacy claims, an average of 8.7 pharmacy claims  per patient. Patients with renal involvement and without hypertension (47%) were  less likely to receive an ACE inhibitor or an ARB than patients with renal  involvement and hypertension (85%) (P <0.001). Patients without renal involvement  or hypertension (19%) were less likely to receive an ACE inhibitor or an ARB than  patients with hypertension and no renal involvement (71%) (P <0.001). The MPR for  all patients was 0.77 ( 0.26). MPR and median gap did not differ significantly by  sex. However, we found a significant correlation between age and MPR (P <0.001).  In this sample with an age range of 18 to 65 years, there was a positive  relationship between patient age and adherence to ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy.  CONCLUSIONS: Physicians. conformity is high when they prescribe an ACE inhibitor  or ARB for patients with diabetes and hypertension but is lower than expected for  patients with diabetes and renal disease but without hypertension. Older patients  in this analysis of persons aged 18 to 65 years adhered more to their ACE  inhibitor or ARB therapy.

TI  - Formulary implications of management of pulmonary arterial Hypertension: Part II--Payer and provider perspectives on new therapeutic options.
AU  - Feldman, Jeremy
AU  - Berenbeim, David
T2  - Managed care interface
AB  - In this two-part white paper from The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Society, the authors have described a number of potent oral therapies available or in late  clinical development for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).  They assert that for optimal clinical efficacy and cost efficiency, patients with  PAH should be managed, and treatment initiated, within specialist tertiary  referral centers. Combination therapy using oral agents with complementary  mechanisms of action may offer increased clinical efficacy over monotherapy and  reduce the need for parenteral therapy; however, combination therapy may be  limited by clinically significant interaction between these agents, such as in  the case of bosentan and sildenafil. Newer treatments may offer less potential  for liver damage and more favorable interaction profiles.

TI  - Can patient demand for pharmaceuticals be moderated?
AU  - Thompson, M.

T2  - Cost & quality : CQ
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ask health plan members whether they would consider switching to a less costly medication or alternative treatment if their physician asked. SAMPLE  & SETTING: Random sample of 265 members of Kaiser Permanente in Northern  California. DESIGN: A telephone survey asked participants to respond to three  vignettes tailored to either men and women age 18 to 39, women age 40-80, or men  age 40-80. MAIN RESULTS: If asked to do so by their doctors, most young adults  (77%) said they would be open to switching to a less expensive allergy medicine,  most women over age 40 (60%) said they would try a less expensive blood pressure  medication, and most men over age 40 (68%) said they would meet with a behavioral  specialist and try other steps before taking ViagraAE. In open feedback,  participants said they would be most receptive if the recommendation came from a  trusted physician, if given the freedom to choose otherwise, and the alternative  was equally effective and convenient. About one-third of participants expressed  reservations or said they would definitely refuse substitution. These refusers  were significantly less satisfied with the health plan, less satisfied with their  primary care doctor, less trusting of Kaiser physicians in general, and in poorer  health (as indicated in one or more vignettes). CONCLUSIONS: Moderating patients'  demand for pharmaceuticals can begin by physicians skillfully asking patients to  consider a more cost-effective alternative to expensive medications when one is  available.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this analysis was to assess the impact of multiple combination therapies on medication possession ratios (MPRs) in an  antihypertensive naive population. METHODS: Data were collected using the  Integrated Healthcare Information Solution's National Benchmark Database (January  1997 to June 2004). Data from patients who received 2-pill pharmacotherapy with  valsartan or valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in a fixed-dose combination  (FDC) + amlodipine were compared with those from patients who received 3-pill  therapy with valsartan + HCTZ + amlodipine as 3 free-drug components. MPR was  calculated by dividing the total days' supply for the lower value in the case of  individual drug components, or the number of days' supply in the case of FDC, by  365 (the number of days during the 1-year study period the medication regimen was  prescribed). A general linear regression was then performed to determine the  effect of treatment group on MPR, controlling for the demographic and clinical  characteristics. RESULTS: Data from 908 patients were included (527 women, 381  men; mean age, 53.9 years; 2-pill treatment with valsartan + amlodipine, 224  patients; 2-pill treatment with valsartan/HCTZ + amlodipine, 619; and 3-pill  therapy with valsartan + HCTZ + amlodipine, 65). The MPR values were 75.4%,  73.1%, and 60.5%, respectively (P = 0.005). MPR improved with age (69.6% in the  subset aged 18-<36 years vs 75.2% in the subset aged >or=64 years; P = 0.023).  CONCLUSIONS: In these antihypertensive-naive patients with hypertension, MPR  decreased with the increase in tablets per regimen, and improved MPR was  correlated with increasing age. These findings suggest patient compliance  improves with simplified pharmacotherapeutic approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of cardiovascular events (CVE) and health care costs in relation to compliance, persistence and level of  blood pressure control when comparing patients treated with single-pill  combinations (SPC) or free combinations (FC) for the treatment of hypertension.  PATIENTS AND METHODS: Observational, multicenter study that included patients>30  years old, from six primary care teams and two hospitals, who started  pharmacological treatment for hypertension during 2006. Two study groups were  established: SPC (ACEIs/diuretics; ARBs/diuretics) and FC (ACEIs+DIU; ARB+DIU,  separately). Main variables studied were sociodemographic data, comorbidity,  Charlson-index, compliance, persistence and achievement of therapeutic goals  (ESH-ESC criteria). The cumulative incidence of CVE and a total-cost model were  determined (differentiating: health/direct; non-health/indirect). Patients were  followed for two years. Statistical analysis included logistic regression, Cox  proportional hazards model and analysis of covariance. Statistical signification:  p<0.05. RESULTS: 1,605 patients were recruited, 1,112 (69.3%) receiving SPC and  493 (30.7%) receiving FC, p<0.001; mean age: 69.4 (12.2) years; women: 55.5%. FC  treatments were associated with ischaemic heart disease (OR=1.4; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0)  and organ failure (OR=1.5; 95% CI: 1.2-2.1), p<0.031. Patients on SPC showed  better therapeutic compliance (77.6% vs 71.9%; p<0.001) and longer persistence of  treatment (62.1% on-treatment at 24-months [95% CI: 56.3-67.9] vs 49.7% [95% CI:  38.5-60.9]; p<0.001). Optimal control of blood pressure was higher in SPC (48.9%  [95% CI: 43.0-54.8] vs 46.7% [95% CI: 35.6-57.8]; p<0.001). Cumulative incidence  of cerebrovascular accidents in FC was 4.6% vs 2.4% in SPC; p=0.041. The total  health care costs were lower in SPC (1,650.7 € vs 1,674.8 €; p<0.001), including  lower specialized care costs (316.1 € vs 382.9 €; p<0.001), fewer hospital  admissions and less loss of labour productivity (44.5 € vs 88.4 €; p<0.001).  CONCLUSIONS: Better compliance and persistence with antihypertensive fixed-dose  combinations improves therapeutic control, leading to a significant reduction of  cerebrovascular accidents and total health care costs.

T2  - American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists
AB  - PURPOSE: Clinical pharmacy interventions and services provided in collaboration with a nurse practitioner in a medically underserved rural health center are  described. METHODS: Data were collected via retrospective chart review of  clinical pharmacy notes for all patients referred to the clinical pharmacist from  July 2001 through February 2004. Data collected included demographic information,  reasons for referral, duration of follow-up, insurance status, use of medication  assistance programs, educational interventions, clinical interventions, and  clinical outcomes. Changes in mean low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol  levels, blood pressures, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) were analyzed  using a paired Student's t test. Smoking cessation, the number of times the  international normalized ratio (INR) was in a goal range, and attainment of goal  LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and HbA(1c) levels were also recorded. RESULTS:  Clinical pharmacy interventions were summarized for 101 patients who were seen in  708 patient visits. A mean of 5.6 educational interventions were provided per  visit, and a mean of 1.0 clinical intervention occurred per visit. Initiation of  new drug therapy or dosage adjustment accounted for 52% of the clinical  interventions. A large percentage of patients attained their goals for LDL  cholesterol (76%), blood pressure (86%), HbA(1c) (69%), INR (82%), and smoking  cessation (43%) during the study period. CONCLUSION: Pharmacotherapy services  provided by a clinical pharmacist at a rural nurse practitioner clinic positively  affected clinical outcomes and increased patients' attainment rates for LDL  cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and HbA(1c).

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A large majority of hypertensive patients are cared for in primary care settings, and most of them do not have adequately controlled  blood pressure. AvMed Health Plan, a large Florida-based, nonprofit, physician  network health maintenance organization, initiated a program to assist primary  care physicians to achieve a greater degree of blood pressure control in their  hypertensive patients. Concomitantly, a study was designed to determine whether  this physician-focused intervention improved blood pressure control in these  patients. METHODS: Data were collected from pharmacy claims and medical charts  for random samples of treated hypertensive patients prior to and following a  6-month educational intervention aimed at providers. Analysis of the data sets  was conducted to determine what percentage of subjects achieved target blood  pressure goals before and after the intervention. RESULTS: At baseline, 41% of  the total population had achieved a target blood pressure of <140/90 mm Hg; 52%  achieved this goal following the intervention. When target blood pressure goals  were defined as <140/90 mm Hg for nondiabetic subjects and < 130/85 mm Hg for  diabetic subjects, 36% of the total population achieved target blood pressure  goals at baseline; 47% achieved these goals following the intervention.  CONCLUSIONS: A physician-focused intervention significantly improved blood  pressure control in diabetic and nondiabetic hypertensive patients enrolled in  AvMed Health Plan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Step therapy for angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) requiring prior use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is a common  cost-containment intervention in managed care. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed  to assess the effectiveness of the step-therapy intervention for ARBs, including  ARB/hydrochlorthiazide (HCTZ) combinations, as measured by prescription use  patterns and antihypertensive drug ingredient costs. METHODS: Rejected and paid  pharmacy claims data were evaluated from 3 health plans with a total membership  of approximately 1 million. These plans had implemented a step-therapy  intervention for ARBs from May 1, 2001, through February 28, 2003. Patients in  the intervention group who had experienced a claim rejection for an ARB within  the first 6 months of program implementation (i.e., had had no ACEI [or ACEI/HCTZ  combination] or ARB [or ARB/HCTZ] claim in the preceding 3 months) were followed  for 1 year after the ARB claim rejection. The rate of initiation of ARB versus  ACEI and other outcomes was compared with similar data from a health plan with  approximately 2 million members that did not have a step-therapy intervention for  ARBs (comparison group). Mean and median total antihypertensive drug ingredient  costs per patient and per day of therapy over 12 months were analyzed for the  intervention and comparison groups. One pharmacy benefit manager administered the  pharmacy benefits for the intervention and comparison health plans during the  entire study period from May 1, 2001, through February 28, 2004, and the drug  formulary was similar for all health plans. RESULTS: In the step-therapy health  plans, before the criterion for 15 months of continuous eligibility was applied,  there were 8,904 patients (approximately 0.9% of health plan members) who either  attempted and were rejected for an ARB or who newly started ACEI therapy,  compared with 44,788 patients (approximately 2.2% of members in the comparison  health plan) who newly started ARB or ACEI therapy without the step-therapy  intervention. After the eligibility criterion was applied, there were 6,758  intervention health plan members (0.7% of members) and 33,709 comparison health  plan members (1.7% of members) in the 2 study groups. In addition to the smaller  proportion of total members affected by the intervention in the ARB step-therapy  health plans, a smaller proportion of ARB/ACEI patients attempted to obtain an  ARB (1,296/6,758 or 19.2%) compared with the health plan without step therapy  (8,697/33,709 or 25.8%, P <0.001). Of the 1,296 patients who attempted to obtain  an ARB and were rejected in the step-therapy group, 578 patients (44.6%) went  through the prior-authorization process and received an ARB as initial therapy,  632 patients (48.8%) received other antihypertensive therapy, and 86 patients  (6.6%) did not receive any antihypertensive therapy within the 12-month follow-up  period. In the 12 months of follow-up, 51.1% (323/632) of patients in the  intervention group who received other antihypertensives as index therapy switched  to or added an ARB, and 1,234 of total ACE/ARB patients (n = 6,758, 18.3%)  received ARB therapy in the health plan with step therapy compared with 10,498 of  33,709 total ACEI/ARB patients (31.1%) who received ARB therapy in the health  plan without step therapy. The mean antihypertensive drug cost per patient was  lower in the intervention group ($370.00) than in the comparison group ($445.12;  P <0.001), and the average cost per day of antihypertensive drug therapy was  12.8% lower in the step-therapy group ($0.82) than in the comparison group  ($0.94). Unadjusted annual cost savings were $75.12 per patient, and ordinary  least squares regression analysis showed that the ARB step-therapy intervention  was associated with $43.91 in antihypertensive drug cost savings per patient over  12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Within 12 months of follow-up, a step-therapy  intervention for ARBs was associated with an 18% ratio of ARB users to total  ACEI/ARB users compared with a 31% ratio in a comparison health plan without the  ARB step-therapy intervention. Approximately 45% of patients who did not receive  an ARB as a result of the step-therapy intervention had either switched to or  added an ARB within 12 months of the intervention, and almost 7% of patients did  not receive any antihypertensive therapy. Antihypertensive drug cost was about  13% lower for the ACEI/ARB patients in the intervention group, creating  approximately $368,000 in savings in 1 year or $0.03 per member per month across  the 1 million health plan members.

AB  - Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) represents a significant challenge to physicians, particularly because of its etiology and nonspecific presentation.  Unfortunately, the majority of patients are not diagnosed until the condition is  at an advanced stage. In this two-part White Paper from The Pharmacy and  Therapeutics Society, prostanoids, administered as continuous intravenous or  subcutaneous infusions, are the most effective treatments but are inconvenient  and costly, owing to complex parenteral administration. The endothelin-receptor  antagonist bosentan and the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor sildenafil are  currently the only oral therapies licensed for PAH; however, bosentan has an  identified risk of liver toxicity. Newer PAH treatments may offer benefits over  existing therapies in terms of less potential for liver damage and more favorable  interaction profiles.

AB  - It is estimated that 18.2 million Americans are currently living with diabetes, a disease that continues to place significant economic burdens on patients, their  families, health plans, systems, and society. Recent data from the American  Diabetes Association indicates that the annual direct and indirect costs of  diabetes are rapidly increasing. Improved glycemic control--which has been  repeatedly demonstrated to reduce the risk of developing microvascular  complications and is likely to reduce the risk of macrovascular complications  associated with type 1 and type 2 diabetes--has the potential to improve quality  of life and reduce health care expenditures. However, despite recent advances in  oral antidiabetic agents and insulin management (e.g., development of rapid- and  long-acting insulin analogs and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]),  only a portion of the patient population is able to achieve the goals for  glycemic control recommended by the American Diabetes Association, the American  College of Endocrinology, and other guideline-setting organizations. Moreover,  improved glycemia achieved with present therapeutic modalities may be associated  with the risk of hypoglycemic events and undesired weight gain. The latter can  negatively affect plasma lipids, blood pressure, and therapy adherence. New  research into the pathophysiology of diabetes indicates that multiple  hormones--not just insulin and glucagon but amylin, GLP-1 (a glucagon-like  peptide), and others--are involved in the regulation of plasma glucose levels,  providing insight into why even insulin is often ineffective in helping patient  with diabetes achieve their glycemic goals. The use of analogs of these newly  recognized, important glucoregulatory hormones; agents that delay the degradation  of the hormones and therefore raise their concentration; and/or agents that bind  to their receptors may facilitate achievement of improved glycemia. One of these  agents, pramlintide, represents the first new potential antihyperglycemic agent  for the treatment of type 1 diabetes since insulin was introduced more than 80  years ago. There is substantial potential for these agents to improve glycemic  control and patient outcomes and to reduce the personal, societal, and economic  burdens of diabetes. Some of these novel multihormonal glucoregulatory therapies  will likely soon become important components of the diabetes armamentarium. It is  therefore important that managed care pharmacy decision makers learn about them.

AB  - In a research project undertaken to describe the content of adult primary care, episodes of illness for six common primary care conditions were analyzed: URI  (upper respiratory infection, UTI (urinary tract infection), HYP (hypertension),  AP (abdominal pain), CP (chest pain), and PE (physical examination). Data from  the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Care Program-Oregon Region were used in the  project. Episode of the six conditions studied tended to be of brief duration; at  least half of the episodes of each condition except hypertension involved only a  single medical visit. The physical examination episodes typically involved both  laboratory and radiology services, but these services were less frequently used  for the other five conditions. Few episodes involved a referral to a consultant  physician, the use of sophisticated ancillary procedures, repeat tests, or a  hospitalization. If patients had been billed for the episode-related care  involved in treating each episode, the average charge incurred (in 1980 dollars)  would have bee: URI $38.67, UTI and HY $52.27 each, AP $66.59, CP $46.54, and PE  $91.65, excluding the costs of pharmaceuticals. Ancillary services accounted for  one-third or more of the costs for each type of episode except URI. The results  suggest that cost savings in primary care are likely to depend less on the  control of sophisticated medical technology than on efficiently meeting  patient-initiated demands for care and on influencing physician-generated  ordering of simple ancillary procedures. The results also suggest the utility of  analyzing the distinctive demands on the medical care system that are generated  by diverse primary care conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The US Joint National Committee (JNC) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure issues guidelines on the optimal  first-line drug therapy in treating hypertension. Despite broad dissemination of  these guidelines, prescribing practices have long remained discrepant with  recommendations. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of insurance  type in the selection of drugs for hypertension treatment in light of the JNC  guidelines. METHODS: Subjects were derived from the 1996 Medical Expenditures  Panel Survey who had a diagnosis of essential hypertension and who were  prescribed a diuretic, beta-blocker, calcium channel blocker (CCB), or ACE  inhibitor (ACEI) as monotherapy. Using the nationally representative sample, this  study presents the first estimates of the impact of insurance policies on the  choice of antihypertensive drugs while controlling for predisposing, enabling,  and need variables in the context of a logistic health-care utilization model.  RESULTS: Nationally in 1996, more than twice as many subjects (7.3 million) were  taking ACEIs or CCBs compared to diuretics or beta-blockers (3.1 million) as the  first-line drug therapy, a sharp contrast to the JNC guidelines. Patients with  health maintenance organization (HMO) insurance were much less likely than fee  for service (FFS) patients to follow the JNC guidelines in this respect (odds  ratio 0.50, P <.01), controlling for all other factors. Individuals with all  other public insurance and no insurance were not statistically different from the  FFS group in the use of the study drugs. Other significant factors in the  regression model were being of African American descent, being unmarried, having  higher out-of-pocket payment, being in excellent physical health, having  diabetes, and being diagnosed with essential hypertension after 1988. Each was  associated with a decreased likelihood of following the JNC recommendations for  the use of diuretics or beta-blockers. CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for other  predisposing, enabling, and need variables, patients who had HMO coverage were  significantly more likely than FFS patients to receive ACEIs or CCBs. Given a  popular public perception of HMOs being most cost conscious in providing health  care, further research is needed to understand why prescribing patterns  associated with HMOs have poorly followed the JNC recommendations.

Despite the fact that this is an obvious opportunity for  improvement, few organizations have launched DM efforts specifically targeting  hypertension, primarily because of the difficulty inherent in predicting ROI.  However, DMA reviews two approaches that are getting notable results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials have provided unequivocal evidence that treatment of hypertension decreases mortality and major disability from cardiovascular disease; however, blood pressure remains inadequately treated in most affected individuals. This large gap continues despite the facts that more than 90% of adults with hypertension have health insurance, and hypertension is the leading cause of visits to the doctor. New approaches are needed to improve hypertension care. OBJECTIVES: The Electronic Communications and Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (e‐BP) study is a three‐arm randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether care based on the Chronic Care Model and delivered over the Internet improves hypertension care. The primary study outcomes are systolic, diastolic, and blood pressure control; secondary outcomes are medication adherence, patient self‐efficacy, satisfaction and quality of life, and healthcare utilization and costs. METHODS: Hypertensive patients receiving care at Group Health medical centers are eligible if they have uncontrolled blood pressure on two screening visits and access to the Web and an e‐mail address. Study participants are randomly assigned to three intervention groups: (a) usual care; (b) home blood pressure monitoring receipt and proficiency training on its use and the Group Health secure patient website (with secure e‐mail access to their healthcare provider, access to a shared medical record, prescription refill and other services); or (c) this plus pharmacist care management (collaborative care management between the patient, the pharmacist, and the patient's physician via a secure patient website and the electronic medical record). CONCLUSION: We will determine whether a new model of patient‐centered care that leverages Web communications, self‐monitoring, and collaborative care management improves hypertension control. If this model proves successful and cost‐effective, similar interventions could be used to improve the care of large numbers of patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To measure clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes associated with a pharmacist‐managed hypertension clinic compared with physician‐managed clinics. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, comparative study. SETTING: Managed care organization. PATIENTS: A total of 330 patients with mild‐to‐moderate essential hypertension. INTERVENTION: Hypertension care provided by either the pharmacist‐managed hypertension clinic or physician‐managed general medical clinics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline and 6‐month evaluations consisted of systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements, a short‐form health survey, and collection of health care utilization information. After treatment, blood pressure measurements were significantly lower (p<0.001) in the pharmacist‐managed hypertension clinic group than in the physician‐managed clinic group. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in the hypertension clinic group. Total costs for the hypertension clinic group were not different from those of the physician‐managed clinic group ($242.46 vs $233.20, p=0.71), but cost:effectiveness ratios were lower in the hypertension clinic group ($27 vs $193/mm Hg for systolic blood pressure readings, and $48 vs $151/mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure readings). CONCLUSION: In a hypertension clinic, pharmacists can be a cost‐effective alternative to physicians in management of patients, and they can improve clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Only about half of patients with high blood pressure (BP) in the United States have their BP controlled. Practical, robust, and sustainable models are needed to improve BP control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an intervention combining home BP telemonitoring with pharmacist case management improves BP control compared with usual care and to determine whether BP control is maintained after the intervention is stopped. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A cluster randomized clinical trial of 450 adults with uncontrolled BP recruited from 14,692 patients with electronic medical records across 16 primary care clinics in an integrated health system in Minneapolis‐St Paul, Minnesota, with 12 months of intervention and 6 months of postintervention follow‐up. INTERVENTIONS: Eight clinics were randomized to provide usual care to patients (n = 222) and 8 clinics were randomized to provide a telemonitoring intervention (n = 228). Intervention patients received home BP telemonitors and transmitted BP data to pharmacists who adjusted antihypertensive therapy accordingly. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Control of systolic BP to less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP to less than 90 mm Hg (<130/80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) at 6 and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were change in BP, patient satisfaction, and BP control at 18 months (6 months after intervention stopped). RESULTS: At baseline, enrollees were 45% women, 82% white, mean (SD) age was 61.1 (12.0) years, and mean systolic BP was 148 mm Hg and diastolic BP was 85 mm Hg. Blood pressure was controlled at both 6 and 12 months in 57.2% (95% CI, 44.8% to 68.7%) of patients in the telemonitoring intervention group vs 30.0% (95% CI, 23.2% to 37.8%) of patients in the usual care group (P = .001). At 18 months (6 months of postintervention follow‐up), BP was controlled in 71.8% (95% CI, 65.0% to 77.8%) of patients in the telemonitoring intervention group vs 57.1% (95% CI, 51.5% to 62.6%) of patients in the usual care group (P = .003). Compared with the usual care group, systolic BP decreased more from baseline among patients in the telemonitoring intervention group at 6 months (‐10.7 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐14.3 to ‐7.3 mm Hg]; P<.001), at 12 months (‐9.7 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐13.4 to ‐6.0 mm Hg]; P<.001), and at 18 months (‐6.6 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐10.7 to ‐2.5 mm Hg]; P = .004). Compared with the usual care group, diastolic BP decreased more from baseline among patients in the telemonitoring intervention group at 6 months (‐6.0 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐8.6 to ‐3.4 mm Hg]; P<.001), at 12 months (‐5.1 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐7.4 to ‐2.8 mm Hg]; P<.001), and at 18 months (‐3.0 mm Hg [95% CI, ‐6.3 to 0.3 mm Hg]; P = .07). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Home BP telemonitoring and pharmacist case management achieved better BP control compared with usual care during 12 months of intervention that persisted during 6 months of postintervention follow‐up.

AB  - Objectives: The Hyperlink trial tested a 12‐month intervention of home blood pressure (BP) telemonitoring with pharmacist case management in adults with uncontrolled hypertension. The intervention resulted in improved BP control compared with usual care at both 6 (72% vs. 45%; P < 0.001) and 12 months (71% vs. 53%; P = 0.005). We sought to investigate factors contributing to intervention success. Design: Mixed‐methods analysis of process of care data, patient focus groups, and pharmacist interviews. Participants: Data from 228 intervention patients were examined from the original 450 patients randomly assigned from 16 primary care clinics. Five patient focus groups and 4 pharmacist interviews were conducted to ascertain the patient and pharmacist perspective. Focus group and interview data were coded, and themes relevant to pharmacists were identified. Outcome measures: Home BP readings of less than 135/85 mm Hg and patient focus group and pharmacist interview themes. Results: Mean BP at the intake visit was 148/85 mm Hg. Antihypertensive medications were adjusted in 10% of patients at the initial in‐person visit, 33% at phone visit 1, 36% at phone visit 2, and 19% at phone visit 3. Thereafter, medication changes declined. The mean home BP for patients at the first phone visit was 136/80 mm Hg, 126/74 mm Hg at 3 months, and 123/73 mm Hg at 5 months, with little change thereafter. Key components of success from patient and pharmacist interviews included a strong patient–pharmacist relationship, individualized treatment plans, and frequent phone contact with the pharmacist. Conclusion: Frequent adjustments to the antihypertensive treatment regimen based on home BP telemonitoring resulted in rapid lowering of BP. Our results suggest that an intensive telephone‐based intervention with the key components of medication adjustments, a strong patient and pharmacist relationship, and individualized treatment plans can achieve BP control in only 3 months in many patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Current intervention programme to improve drug adherence are either too complex or expensive for implementation and scale‐up in low‐middle‐income countries. The aim of this study is to assess the process and effects of implementing a low‐cost, targeted and tailored pharmacist intervention among patients with type 2 diabetes who are non‐adherent to antihypertensive drugs in a real‐world primary care Indonesian setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cluster randomised controlled trial with a 3‐month follow‐up will be conducted in 10 community health centres (CHCs) in Indonesia. Type 2 diabetes patients aged 18 years and older who reported non‐adherence to antihypertensive drugs according to the Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS) are eligible to participate. Patients in CHCs randomised to the intervention group will receive a tailored intervention based on their personal adherence barriers. Interventions may include reminders, habit‐based strategies, family support, counselling to educate and motivate patients, and strategies to address other drug‐related problems. Interventions will be provided at baseline and at a 1‐month follow‐up. Simple question‐based flowcharts and an innovative adherence intervention wheel are provided to support the pharmacy staff. Patients in CHCs randomised to the control group will receive usual care based on the Indonesian guideline. The primary outcome is the between‐group difference in medication adherence change from baseline to 3‐month follow‐up assessed by MARS. Secondary outcomes include changes in patients' blood pressure, their medication beliefs assessed by the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ)‐specific, as well as process characteristics of the intervention programme from a pharmacist and patient perspective. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee of Universitas Padjadjaran, Indonesia (No. 859/UN6.KEP/EC/2019) and all patients will provide written informed consent prior to participation. The findings of the study will be disseminated through international conferences, one or more peer‐reviewed journals and reports to key stakeholders. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04023734.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the effect of a pharmaceutical care program on the coronary heart disease risk in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients. METHODS: A total of 200 elderly (> 60 years) diabetic and/or hypertensive patients were recruited into a randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial with a 36‐month follow‐up, developed in a public primary health care unit in a municipality in the Brazilian State of Sao Paulo. A range of clinical measurements were evaluated at the baseline and up to 36 months afterwards. The intervention group patients received pharmaceutical care from a clinical pharmacist, whereas the control group patients received their usual care from the medical and nursing staff. The Framingham scoring method was used to estimate changes in the 10‐year coronary heart disease risk scores of all the patients. RESULTS: A total of 194 patients completed the study. Significant reductions (p < 0.05) in the mean values (baseline vs. 36 months) for the systolic blood pressure [156.7 mmHg vs 133.7 mmHg; P < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (106.6 mmHg vs. 91.6 mmHg; P < 0.001),fasting glucose (135.1 mg/dL vs. 107.9 mg/dL; P < 0.001), hemoglobin A1C (7.7% vs. 7.0%; P <0.001), triglycerides (206.0 mg/dL vs. 152.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001), low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)cholesterol (112.4 mg/dL vs. 102.0 mg/dL; P < 0.001), high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (55.5 mg/dL vs. 65.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001), total cholesterol (202.5 mg/dL vs. 185.9 mg/dL; P < 0.001), body mass index (26.2 kg/m2 vs. 26.1 kg/m2; P < 0.001), and abdominal circumference (103.2 cm vs. 102.5 cm; P= 0.001) were observed in the intervention group, whereas no significant changes were verified in the control group. The mean Framingham risk prediction score in the intervention group was 6.8% at baseline and decreased to 4.5%; P < 0.001) after 36 months, but remained unchanged in the control group. CONCLUSION: The pharmaceutical care program resulted in better clinical measurements and reduced the cardiovascular risk scores in elderly diabetic and hypertensive patients over a 36‐month period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is a leading mortality risk factor yet inadequately controlled in most affected subjects. Effective programs to address this problem are lacking. We hypothesized that an information technology‐supported management program could help improve blood pressure (BP) control. METHODS AND RESULTS: This randomized controlled trial included 223 primary care hypertensive subjects with mean 24‐hour BP >130/80 and daytime BP >135/85 mm Hg measured with ambulatory monitoring (ABPM). Intervention subjects received a BP monitor and access to an information technology‐supported adherence and BP monitoring system providing nurses, pharmacists, and physicians with monthly reports. Control subjects received usual care. The mean (+/‐SD) follow‐up was 348 (+/‐78) and 349 (+/‐84) days in the intervention and control group, respectively. The primary end point of the change in the mean 24‐hour ambulatory BP was consistently greater in intervention subjects for both systolic (‐11.9 versus ‐7.1 mm Hg; P<0.001) and diastolic BP (‐6.6 versus ‐4.5 mm Hg; P=0.007). The proportion of subjects that achieved Canadian Guideline target BP (46.0% versus 28.6%) was also greater in the intervention group (P=0.006). We observed similar BP declines for ABPM and self‐recorded home BP suggesting the latter could be an alternative for confirming BP control. The intervention was associated with more physician‐driven antihypertensive dose adjustments or changes in agents (P=0.03), more antihypertensive classes at study end (P=0.007), and a trend toward improved adherence measured by prescription refills (P=0.07). CONCLUSIONS: This multidisciplinary information technology‐supported program that provided feedback to patients and healthcare providers significantly improved blood pressure levels in a primary care setting.

AB  - Background: It is important to understand which components of successful multifaceted interventions are responsible for study outcomes, since some components may be more important contributors to the intervention effect than others. Objective: We conducted a mediation analysis to determine which of seven factors had the greatest effect on change in systolic blood pressure (BP) after 6 months in a trial to improve hypertension control. Design: The study was a preplanned secondary analysis of a cluster‐randomized clinical trial. Eight clinics in an integrated health system were randomized to provide usual care to their patients (n = 222), and eight were randomized to provide a telemonitoring intervention (n = 228). Participants: Four hundred three of 450 trial participants completing the 6‐month follow‐up visit were included. Interventions: Intervention group participants received home BP telemonitors and transmitted measurements to pharmacists, who adjusted medications and provided advice to improve adherence to medications and lifestyle modification via telephone visits. Main measures: Path analytic models estimated indirect effects of the seven potential mediators of intervention effect (defined as the difference between the intervention and usual care groups in change in systolic BP from baseline to 6 months). The potential mediators were change in home BP monitor use, number of BP medication classes, adherence to BP medications, physical activity, salt intake, alcohol use, and weight. Key Results: The difference in change in systolic BP was 11.3 mmHg. The multivariable mediation model explained 47 % (5.3 mmHg) of the intervention effect. Nearly all of this was mediated by two factors: an increase in medication treatment intensity (24 %) and increased home BP monitor use (19 %). The other five factors were not significant mediators, although medication adherence and salt intake improved more in the intervention group than in the usual care group. Conclusions: Most of the explained intervention effect was attributable to the combination of self‐monitoring and medication intensification. High adherence at baseline and the relatively low intensity of resources directed toward lifestyle change may explain why these factors did not contribute to the improvement in BP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most diabetic and hypertensive patients, principally the elderly, do not achieve adequate disease control and consume 5%‐15% of annual health care budgets. Previous studies verified that pharmaceutical care is useful for achieving adequate disease control in diabetes and hypertension. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the economic cost and the incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality‐adjusted life‐year (QALY) of pharmaceutical care in the management of diabetes and hypertension in elderly patients in a primary public health care system in a developing country. METHODS: A 36‐month randomized controlled clinical trial was performed with 200 patients who were divided into a control group (n = 100) and an intervention group (n = 100). The control group received the usual care offered by the Primary Health Care Unit (medical and nurse consultations). The intervention group received the usual care plus a pharmaceutical care intervention. The intervention and control groups were compared with regard to the direct costs of health services (i.e., general practitioner, specialist, nurse, and pharmacist appointments; emergency room visits; and drug therapy costs) and the ICER per QALY. These evaluations used the health system perspective. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference was found between the intervention and control groups in total direct health care costs ($281.97 +/‐ $49.73 per patient vs. $212.28 +/‐ $43.49 per patient, respectively; P = 0.089); pharmaceutical care added incremental costs of $69.60 (+/‐ $7.90) per patient. The ICER per QALY was $53.50 (95% CI = $51.60‐ $54.00; monetary amounts are given in U.S. dollars). Every clinical parameter evaluated improved for the pharmaceutical care group, whereas these clinical parameters remained unchanged in the usual care group. The difference in differences (DID) tests indicated that for each clinical parameter, the patients in the intervention group improved more from pre to post than the control group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: While pharmaceutical care did not significantly increase total direct health care costs, significantly improved health outcomes were seen. The mean ICER per QALY gained suggests a favorable cost‐effectiveness.

AB  - Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) in the United States. Multiple risk factors contribute to DKD development, yet few interventions target more than a single DKD risk factor at a time. This manuscript describes the study protocol, recruitment, and baseline participant characteristics for the Simultaneous Risk Factor Control Using Telehealth to slOw Progression of Diabetic Kidney Disease (STOP‐DKD) study. The STOP‐DKD study is a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifactorial behavioral and medication management intervention to mitigate kidney function decline at 3 years compared to usual care. The intervention consists of up to 36 monthly educational modules delivered via telephone by a study pharmacist, home blood pressure monitoring, and medication management recommendations delivered electronically to primary care physicians. Patients seen at seven primary care clinics in North Carolina, with diabetes and [1] uncontrolled hypertension and [2] evidence of kidney dysfunction (albuminuria or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) were eligible to participate. Study recruitment completed in December 2014. Of the 281 participants randomized, mean age at baseline was 61.9; 52% were male, 56% were Black, and most were high school graduates (89%). Baseline co‐morbidity was high‐ mean blood pressure was 134/76 mmHg, mean body mass index was 35.7 kg/m2, mean eGFR was 80.7 ml/min/1.73 m2, and mean glycated hemoglobin was 8.0%. Experiences of recruiting and implementing a comprehensive DKD program to individuals at high risk seen in the primary care setting are provided. Trial Registration:NCT01829256.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately half of patients with chronic cardiometabolic conditions are nonadherent with their prescribed medications. Interventions to improve adherence have been only modestly effective because they often address single barriers to adherence, intervene at single points in time, or are imprecisely targeted to patients who may not need adherence assistance. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a multicomponent, behaviorally tailored pharmacist‐based intervention to improve adherence to medications for diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. TRIAL DESIGN: The STIC2IT trial is a cluster‐randomized pragmatic trial testing the impact of a pharmacist‐led multicomponent intervention that uses behavioral interviewing, text messaging, mailed progress reports, and video visits. Targeted patients are those who are nonadherent to glucose‐lowering, antihypertensive, or statin medications and who also have evidence of poor disease control. The intervention is tailored to patients' individual health barriers and their level of health activation. We cluster‐randomized 14 practice sites of a large multispecialty group practice to receive either the pharmacist‐based intervention or usual care. STIC2IT has enrolled 4,076 patients who will be followed up for 12months after randomization. The trial's primary outcome is medication adherence, assessed using pharmacy claims data. Secondary outcomes are disease control and health care resource utilization. CONCLUSION: This trial will determine whether a technologically enabled, behaviorally targeted pharmacist‐based intervention results in improved adherence and disease control. If effective, this strategy could be a scalable method of offering tailored adherence support to those with the greatest clinical need.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: CKD is characterized by remarkably high hospitalization and readmission rates. Our study aim was to test a medication therapy management intervention to reduce subsequent acute care utilization. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The CKD Medication Intervention Trial was a single‐blind (investigators), randomized clinical trial conducted at Providence Health Care in Spokane, Washington. Patients with CKD stages 3‐5 not treated by dialysis who were hospitalized for acute illness were recruited. The intervention was designed to improve posthospitalization care by medication therapy management. A pharmacist delivered the intervention as a single home visit within 7 days of discharge. The intervention included these fundamental elements: comprehensive medication review, medication action plan, and a personal medication list. The primary outcome was a composite of acute care utilization (hospital readmissions and emergency department and urgent care visits) for 90 days after hospitalization. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics of participants (n=141) included the following: age, 69±11 (mean±SD) years old; women, 48% (67 of 141); diabetes, 56% (79 of 141); hypertension, 83% (117 of 141); eGFR, 41±14 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (serum creatinine‐based Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation); and urine albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio median, 43 mg/g (interquartile range, 8‐528) creatinine. The most common primary diagnoses for hospitalization were the following: cardiovascular events, 36% (51 of 141); infections, 18% (26 of 141); and kidney diseases, 12% (17 of 141). The primary outcome occurred in 32 of 72 (44%) of the medication intervention group and 28 of 69 (41%) of those in usual care (log rank P=0.72). For only hospital readmission, the rate was 19 of 72 (26%) in the medication intervention group and 18 of 69 (26%) in the usual care group (log rank P=0.95). There was no between‐group difference in achievement of guideline‐based goals for use of renin‐angiotensin system inhibition or for BP, hemoglobin, phosphorus, or parathyroid hormone. CONCLUSIONS: Acute care utilization after hospitalization was not reduced by a pharmacist‐led medication therapy management intervention at the transition from hospital to home.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Even in high‐performing health systems, some patients with diabetes mellitus have poor blood pressure (BP) control because of poor medication adherence and lack of medication intensification. We examined whether the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention, a pharmacist‐led intervention combining elements found in efficacy studies to lower BP, improved BP among patients with diabetes mellitus with persistent hypertension and poor refill adherence or insufficient medication intensification in 2 high‐performing health systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective, multisite cluster randomized pragmatic trial with randomization of 16 primary care teams at 5 medical centers (3 Veterans Affairs and 2 Kaiser Permanente) to the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention or usual care. The primary outcome was relative change in systolic BP (SBP), comparing 1797 intervention with 2303 control team patients, from 6 months preceding to 6 months after the 14‐month intervention period. We examined shorter‐term changes in SBP as a secondary outcome. The mean SBP decrease from 6 months before to 6 months after the intervention period was ≈9 mm Hg in both arms. Mean SBPs of eligible intervention patients were 2.4 mm Hg lower (95% CI: ‐3.4 to ‐1.5; P<0.001) immediately after the intervention than those achieved by control patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Adherence and Intensification of Medications program more rapidly lowered SBPs among intervention patients, but usual‐care patients achieved equally low SBP levels by 6 months after the intervention period. These findings show the importance of evaluating in different real‐life clinical settings programs found in efficacy trials to be effective before urging their widespread adoption in all settings.

T2  - Clinical and experimental hypertension (New York, N.Y. : 1993)
AB  - Evening dosing of antihypertensive medications lowers nighttime blood pressure, and in one large randomized trial, it reduced the risk for cardiovascular outcomes. However, the feasibility of nighttime dosing in routine clinical practice is unknown. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of a brief pharmacist intervention to assign patients to take antihypertensive medications at specific times of the day. In this pilot, randomized controlled trial, 79 patients with moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) taking one or more antihypertensive medications once daily were randomized to take one once‐daily antihypertensive either in the morning or in the evening. A total of 79 patients were randomized (39 to morning dosing, 40 to evening dosing). Average (SD) age was 56.5 (14) years, 68% were male, and average (SD) estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 36.6 (8.9) mL/min/1.73m2. Adherence, defined as taking the once‐daily medication at the time indicated six or seven times in the last 7 days and not taking it at any other time during the day, was 91% in the morning arm and 95% in the evening arm (p = 0.57). This pilot demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of a pharmacist‐physician collaborative to assign once‐daily antihypertensive medications to either morning or evening dosing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Group medical clinics (GMCs) are widely used in the management of diabetes and hypertension, but data on their effectiveness are limited. OBJECTIVE: To test the effectiveness of GMCs in the management of comorbid diabetes and hypertension. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00286741) SETTING: 2 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in North Carolina and Virginia. PATIENTS: 239 patients with poorly controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A(1c) [HbA(1c)] level > or =7.5%) and hypertension (systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg). INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned within each center to either attend a GMC or receive usual care. Clinics comprised 7 to 8 patients and a care team that consisted of a primary care general internist, a pharmacist, and a nurse or other certified diabetes educator. Each session included structured group interactions moderated by the educator. The pharmacist and physician adjusted medication to manage each patient's HbA(1c) level and blood pressure. MEASUREMENTS: Hemoglobin A(1c) level and systolic blood pressure, measured by blinded research personnel at baseline, study midpoint (median, 6.8 months), and study completion (median follow‐up, 12.8 months). Linear mixed models, adjusted for clustering within GMCs, were used to compare HbA(1c) levels and systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: Mean baseline systolic blood pressure and HbA(1c) level were 152.9 mm Hg (SD, 14.2) and 9.2% (SD, 1.4), respectively. At the end of the study, mean systolic blood pressure improved by 13.7 mm Hg in the GMC group and 6.4 mm Hg in the usual care group (P = 0.011 by linear mixed model), whereas mean HbA(1c) level improved by 0.8% in the GMC group and 0.5% in the usual care group (P = 0.159). LIMITATION: Measurements of effectiveness may have been limited by concomitant improvements in the usual care group that were due to co‐intervention. CONCLUSION: Group medical clinics are a potent strategy for improving blood pressure but not HbA(1c) level in diabetic patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimization of systolic blood pressure and lipid levels are essential for secondary prevention after ischemic stroke, but there are substantial gaps in care, which could be addressed by nurse‐ or pharmacist‐led care. We compared 2 types of case management (active prescribing by pharmacists or nurse‐led screening and feedback to primary care physicians) in addition to usual care. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial involving adults with recent minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack whose systolic blood pressure or lipid levels were above guideline targets. Participants in both groups had a monthly visit for 6 months with either a nurse or pharmacist. Nurses measured cardiovascular risk factors, counselled patients and faxed results to primary care physicians (active control). Pharmacists did all of the above as well as prescribed according to treatment algorithms (intervention). RESULTS: Most of the 279 study participants (mean age 67.6 yr, mean systolic blood pressure 134 mm Hg, mean low‐density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol 3.23 mmol/L) were already receiving treatment at baseline (antihypertensives: 78.1%; statins: 84.6%), but none met guideline targets (systolic blood pressure ≤ 140 mm Hg, fasting LDL cholesterol ≤ 2.0 mmol/L). Substantial improvements were observed in both groups after 6 months: 43.4% of participants in the pharmacist case manager group met both systolic blood pressure and LDL guideline targets compared with 30.9% in the nurse‐led group (12.5% absolute difference; number needed to treat = 8, p = 0.03). INTERPRETATION: Compared with nurse‐led case management (risk factor evaluation, counselling and feedback to primary care providers), active case management by pharmacists substantially improved risk factor control at 6 months among patients who had experienced a stroke.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Whether screening for chronic kidney disease (CKD) can improve the care of persons at high risk for complications remains uncertain. We describe the design and early implementation experience of a pilot, cluster‐randomized pragmatic trial to evaluate the feasibility, implementation, and effectiveness of a "triple marker" CKD screening program (creatinine, cystatin C and albumin to creatinine ratio) for improving care among hypertensive veterans seen in primary care at one Veterans Administration Hospital. METHODS/DESIGN: Non‐diabetic hypertensive veterans age 18‐80 without known CKD were randomized in clusters determined by primary care provider (unit of randomization) into three arms. Usual care will be compared with two incrementally intensified treatment strategies: (1) screen for CKD followed by patient and provider education or (2) screen‐educate plus a clinical pharmacist‐led CKD and BP management program. The primary clinical outcome is systolic blood pressure (BP) change from baseline. Secondary clinical outcome is BP control. The primary process outcomes is triple marker screening (across three arms), and secondary process outcomes include use of inhibitors of the renin‐angiotensin system (ACE/ARB) overall and in persons with albuminuria, CKD recognition by PCP, use of non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and NSAID education by PCP. The design uses the Veterans Health Administration electronic health record (EHR) to identify participants, deliver the interventions and ascertain study outcomes. Assessment of the program implementation will use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE‐AIM) framework. Study duration is 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 1,819 patients have been randomized within 41 provider clusters. The median age (interquartile range) is 68 years (61‐72), and 99% of participants are male. Approximately 16% are Black, and 5% Hispanic. In the first 6 months of the trial, 434 triple marker screening tests have been ordered, and 217(50%) have been tested. A total of 48 new CKD cases have been identified among those tested, for a preliminary yield of 22%. CONCLUSION: We have successfully implemented a pragmatic protocol that uses the EHR to identify and characterize eligible participants, deliver the intervention, and ascertain study outcomes with high rates of participation by providers and patients. Results from this study can guide design of pragmatic trials in the field of CKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01978951 ; Date or Registration: 1/17/2014.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the pattern of physicians' prescription of antihypertensive drugs and its possible effects on blood pressure control as well as physicians' compliance with recommended guidelines. METHODS: Records of 145 patients aged 17‐91 (mean: 52.6+/‐14.6) years, with male to female ratio of 1:1.2 were randomly selected. Information on antihypertensive prescriptions was recorded. Blood pressure control was defined as systolic and diastolic blood pressure less than 140 mm Hg and 90 mmHg, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 145 patients studied, 20% (29) were on monotherapy and 80% (116) on combination therapy. Of the patients on combination therapy, 61.2% (71), 33.6% (39) and 5.2% (6) were on 2, 3 and 4 drugs, respectively. Diuretic was the most frequently p rescribed drug either as a single agent (44.8%) or as combination therapy (88.8%). Mean reductions in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were more in patients on calcium channel blocker than those on diuretic monotherapy (t=2.5 and 3.6 for reductions in systolic and diastolic BP, respectively; P<.05 for both), and, in patients on combination therapy than those on monotherapy (t=3.64 and 3.27 for reductions in systolic and diastolic BP, respectively; P<.01 for both). Blood pressure control rate was 30.5%. CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with the previously observed benefits of antihypertensive combination therapy, and demonstrate an apparent higher efficacy of calcium channel blocker monotherapy than diuretic monotherapy in blood pressure lowering in the study population. Major limitations of this work include its retrospective nature and the inability to determine the actual patients' adherence to therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of a pharmacist in primary health care settings of Pakistan is still obscure. Thus, we aimed to demonstrate the pharmacist‐led improvements in glycemic, blood pressure and lipid controls in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients of Lahore, Pakistan. METHODS: The first open label, randomized control trial conducted at a primary health care facility of Lahore, Pakistan by enrolling 244 uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (hemoglobin A1 c, (HbA1c); 10.85 ± 1.74) patients. The pharmacological intervention included identification of drug related problems, drug interactions, change in dose, frequency and therapy switches in collaboration with physician, while non‐pharmacological intervention consisted of diet, lifestyle and behavior counseling. Outcome measures were glycemic (HbA1c), blood pressure and lipid controls. RESULTS: In intra‐group comparison, compared to control arm (C, n = 52), subjects in the intervention arm (I, n = 83) demonstrated significant differences in process outcome measures; baseline vs final, such as HbA1c (C; 10.3 ± 1.3 vs 9.7 ± 1.3, p <  0.001, I; 10.9 ± 1.7 vs 7.7 ± 0.9, p <  0.0001), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (C; 129.9 ± 13.9 vs 136 ± 7.1, p = 0.0001, I; 145 ± 20.4 vs 123.9 ± 9.9 mmHg, p <  0.0001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (C; + 4, p = 0.03, I; ‐ 7 mmHg, p <  0.0001), cholesterol (C; 235.8 ± 57.7 vs 220.9 ± 53.2, p = 0.15, I; 224 ± 55.2 vs 153 ± 25.9 mg/dL, p < 0.0001), triglycerides (C; 213.2 ± 86.6 vs 172.4 ± 48.7, p = 0.001, I; 273 ± 119.4 vs 143 ± 31.6 mg/dL, p < 0.0001) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (C; 77.5 ± 18.6 vs 76 ± 14.2, p = 0.5, I; 69.4 ± 21.3 vs 93.8 ± 15.2 ml/min/1.73m2, p < 0.0001). Likewise, inter‐group improvements were more significant in the subjects of intervention group at final follow up in comparison to control for various process outcome measures; HbA1c (p < 0.001), SBP (p < 0.0001), DBP (p = 0.02), cholesterol (p < 0.0001), triglycerides (p < 0.0001), SCr (p < 0.001), eGFR (p < 0.001). Moreover, both male and female subjects exhibited similar responses towards intervention with similar improvements in outcome measures. CONCLUSION: These data suggested that pharmacist intervention in collaboration with physician in primary health care settings may result in significant improvements in glycemic, blood pressure and lipid controls in Pakistani population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered retrospectively with International Standard Registered Clinical/soCial sTudy Number (ISRCTN) registry on July 26, 2017 under nutritional, metabolic, endocrine category with assigned registration # ISRCTN22657497 and can be assessed at https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN22657497.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The practice of pharmaceutical care in primary care settings in Thailand is currently not generally accepted. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of pharmacist involvement in treatment with hypertensive patients in primary care settings. METHODS: The treatment objective was to stabilize the blood pressure (BP) of hypertensive patients in accordance with the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guidelines. Patients were randomly assigned to a pharmacist‐involved group (treatment) or a group with no pharmacist involvement (control). Pre‐ and post‐test BPs, tablet counts, lifestyle modifications, and pharmacists' recommendations were recorded. The 6‐month study was carried out in Mahasarakham University pharmacy and 2 primary care units. Patients were monitored monthly by reviewing their medications and supported by providing pharmaceutical care and counseling. RESULTS: From a total of 235 patients, the treatment group (n = 118) had a significant reduction in both systolic (S) and diastolic (D) BP compared with the 117 patients of the control group (p = 0.037, 0.027, respectively). The 158 patients (76 treatment, 82 control) with BPs >or=140/90 mm Hg at the beginning of the study showed significant BP reductions (p = 0.002 SBP, 0.008 DBP). The proportion of 158 patients whose BP became stabilized was higher in the treatment group (p = 0.017). The treatment group showed significantly better adherence (p = 0.014) and exercise control (p = 0.012) at the end of the study. Physicians accepted 42.72% of medication modifications and 5.34% of the suggestions for additional investigations. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive patients who received pharmacist input achieved a significantly greater benefit in BP reduction, BP control, and improvement in adherence rate and lifestyle modification.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of a community‐based, pharmacist‐directed diabetes management program among managed care organization enrollees using National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)‐Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) performance measures. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Regional community pharmacy chain in Tulsa, OK, from November 2005 to July 2007. PATIENTS: 52 participants with diabetes and hypertension who were enrolled in a managed care organization. INTERVENTION: Diabetes management versus standard care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comprehensive diabetes care measures of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C <7.0%), blood pressure (<130/80 mm Hg), and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (<100 mg/dL). A composite research outcome of success was created by determining whether a participant achieved two of the three HEDIS goals at the end of 9 months. RESULTS: 46.7% of intervention group participants achieved the A1C goal, while 9.1% of control group participants achieved the goal ( P < 0.002). More than one‐half (53.3%) of intervention participants achieved the blood pressure goal compared with 22.7% of control participants ( P < 0.02). Among control group participants, 50% achieved the LDL cholesterol goal compared with 46.67% of intervention group participants. The odds of the intervention group attaining the composite goal were 5.87 times greater than the control group. CONCLUSION: A community pharmacy‐based diabetes management program was effective in achieving A1C and blood pressure goals measured by NCQA‐HEDIS performance standards. Program participants were statistically significantly more likely to achieve two of three HEDIS standards during a 9‐month period.

T2  - Public health
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether the provision of further practice‐based support by pharmacists will bring about improved outcomes for blood pressure (BP) control in middle‐aged and elderly Nigerian hypertensive patients managed with combination diuretics (amiloride hydrochloride 5 mg+hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg) and/or methyl dopa at the primary care level. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a 1‐year prospective, randomized cohort study of the outpatients of a state comprehensive health centre in South‐western Nigeria. Free primary health services including free drugs were provided for all patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD: The study population comprised 51 Nigerian patients with uncomplicated hypertension aged 45 years or more, with a 0.2‐3.0‐year history of hypertension, registered at the Comprehensive Health Centre, Ife between October 2002 and March 2003. They were invited into the pharmacist‐managed hypertension clinic and followed for the study period. Participating pharmacists counselled for current medication, personalized goals of lifestyle modification stressing weight loss and/or increased activity, increased patient awareness by providing relevant education about hypertension and associated/related diseases, adjusted drug therapy to optimize effectiveness and minimize adverse events, utilized treatment schedules that enhanced patients' adherence to therapy, and monitored treatment outcomes between enrollment and return visits. Patient satisfaction and the number of treatment failures within 6 months post enrollment were compared with retrospective data from our earlier study involving physician‐managed patients under a similar setting. RESULTS: Uncontrolled BP reduced from 92 to 36.2% by 10.15+/‐5.02 days after enrollment. Treatment failures were observed at 5.9% of the total return visits (n=184) within 6 months. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist‐managed hypertension clinics can improve BP control, reduce treatment failure and increase patient satisfaction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a 9‐month community pharmacy‐based medication therapy management (MTM) program on quality of care in patients with diabetes and hypertension. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Tulsa, OK, between November 2005 and July 2007. PATIENTS: 52 patients with diabetes and hypertension who were enrolled in a managed care organization. INTERVENTION: During monthly visits, intervention group participants received MTM services for hypertension and diabetes management. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Systolic blood pressure (SBP), percentage at goal blood pressure (<130/80 mm Hg), and antihypertensive medication adherence. RESULTS: The mean intervention group SBP decreased 17.32 mm Hg, whereas the mean control group SBP level increased 2.73 mm Hg (P = 0.003). The percentage of patients at goal blood pressure increased from 16.0% to 48.0% in the intervention group and decreased from 20.0% to 6.67% in the control group. Intervention group participants were 12.92 times more likely than control group participants to achieve goal blood pressure (P = 0.021). Although the mean adherence rate in the intervention group increased 7.0% while remaining fairly constant in the control group (‐0.7%), this group difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: A community pharmacy‐based hypertension MTM program was effective in improving blood pressure control among managed care enrollees with diabetes and hypertension. Community pharmacists are strategically positioned to provide MTM services and effectively communicate with providers to improve quality of care for patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension is poorly controlled. Team‐based care and changes in the process of care have been proposed to address these quality problems. However, assessing care processes is difficult because they are often confounded even in randomized behavioral studies by unmeasured confounders based on discretion of health care providers. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of process measures including number of counseling sessions about lifestyle modification and number of antihypertensive medications on blood pressure change and payer‐perspective treatment costs. METHODS: Data were obtained from two prospective, cluster randomized controlled clinical trials (Trial A and B) implementing physician‐pharmacist collaborative interventions compared with usual care over six months in community‐based medical offices in the Midwest. Multivariate linear regression models with both instrumental variable methods and as‐treated methods were utilized. Instruments were indicators for trial and study arms. Models of blood pressure change and costs included both process measures, demographic variables, and clinical variables. RESULTS: The analysis included 496 subjects. As‐treated methods showed no significant associations between process and outcomes. The instruments used in the study were insufficient to simultaneously identify distinct process effects. However, the post‐hoc instrumental variable models including one process measure at a time while controlling for the other process demonstrated significant associations between the processes and outcomes with estimates considerably larger than as‐treated estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Instrumental variable methods with combined randomized behavioral studies may be useful to evaluate the effects of different care processes. However, substantial distinct process variation across studies is needed to fully capitalize on this approach. Instrumental variable methods focusing on individual processes provided larger and stronger outcome relationships than those found using as‐treated methods which are subject to confounding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with hypertension continue to have less than optimal blood pressure control, with nearly one in five Canadian adults having hypertension. Pharmacist prescribing is gaining favor as a potential clinically efficacious and cost‐effective means to improve both access and quality of care. With Alberta being the first province in Canada to have independent prescribing by pharmacists, it offers a unique opportunity to evaluate outcomes in patients who are prescribed antihypertensive therapy by pharmacists. METHODS: The study is a randomized controlled trial of enhanced pharmacist care, with the unit of randomization being the patient. Participants will be randomized to enhanced pharmacist care (patient identification, assessment, education, close follow‐up, and prescribing/titration of antihypertensive medications) or usual care. Participants are patients in rural Alberta with undiagnosed/uncontrolled blood pressure, as defined by the Canadian Hypertension Education Program. The primary outcome is the change in systolic blood pressure between baseline and 24 weeks in the enhanced‐care versus usual‐care arms. There are also three substudies running in conjunction with the project examining different remuneration models, investigating patient knowledge, and assessing health‐resource utilization amongst patients in each group. DISCUSSION: To date, one‐third of the required sample size has been recruited. There are 15 communities and 17 pharmacists actively screening, recruiting, and following patients. This study will provide high‐level evidence regarding pharmacist prescribing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00878566.

AB  - Team‐based care has been recommended for patients with treatment‐resistant hypertension (TRH), but its efficacy in this setting is unknown. We compared a physician‐pharmacist collaborative model (PPCM) to usual care in patients with TRH participating in the Collaboration Among Pharmacists and Physicians To Improve Outcomes Now study. At baseline, 169 patients (27% of Collaboration Among Pharmacists and Physicians To Improve Outcomes Now patients) had TRH: 111 received the PPCM intervention and 58 received usual care. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment arms. After 9 months, adjusted mean systolic blood pressure was reduced by 7 mm Hg more with PPCM intervention than usual care (P = .036). Blood pressure control was 34.2% with PPCM versus 25.9% with usual care (adjusted odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.33‐11.2). These findings suggest that team‐based care in the primary care setting may be effective for TRH. Additional research is needed regarding the long‐term impact of these models and to identify patients most likely to benefit from team‐based interventions.

AB  - Study Objective: To evaluate whether a simple pharmacist protocol, consisting of patient screening and cardiovascular risk stratification, identification and reminders about uncontrolled risk factors, and drug adherence support, can significantly reduce cardiovascular risk. Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled pilot study. Setting. Large primary care medical clinic in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Patients: One hundred seventy‐six adult patients (mean age 60 yrs) who exhibited a 10‐year Framingham risk score of 15% or greater, or a coronary artery disease risk equivalent (coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or diabetes mellitus). Intervention: Eligible patients initially met with the pharmacist to receive general counselling about cardiovascular disease and were then randomly assigned to receive ongoing follow‐up by the pharmacist (follow‐up group [88 patients]) or to return to usual care (single‐contact group [88 patients]) for a minimum of 6 months. Measurements and Main Results: The primary end point was mean reduction in the 10‐year Framingham risk score. Secondary end points included individual modifiable risk factors (systolic and diastolic blood pressures; total cholesterol, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL], and triglyceride levels; total cholesterol:HDL ratio; and hemoglobin A1c value), as well as statin utilization, initiation, and adherence rates. Baseline characteristics were similar across both groups. Neither the mean reduction in 10‐year risk (‐2.68 for the follow‐up group and ‐1.25 for the single‐contact group, one‐tailed p=0.098) nor individual risk factors were significantly different between groups. The proportion of patients exhibiting statin adherence of 80% or greater did not significantly differ between groups at study end (73.1% [57/78] and 80.0% [52/65], respectively, p=0.333). However, 85.2% (75/88) in the follow‐up group continued with statin therapy at the end of the study compared with 67.0% (59/88) in the single‐contact group (p=0.005). Statin initiations were more frequent in the follow‐up group than in the single‐contact group (75.0% [30/40) vs 48.9% [22/45], p=0.013). Conclusion: This simple cardiovascular care protocol for nonspecialist pharmacists did not result in a clear improvement to cardiovascular risk reduction success among patients in a primary care medical clinic. The intervention did, however, appear to improve statin utilization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient adherence is necessary for successful medication therapy. However, highly complex medication regimens may lead to poor adherence, which decreases the effectiveness of treatment and often results in treatment failure, excessive morbidity and mortality, and higher costs.  OBJECTIVE: To examine whether patient adherence can be increased indirectly through reducing medication complexity by (a) pharmaceutical counseling of hospital medical staff and (b) additional information in the discharge letter for the primary care provider (PCP) about the simplified discharge medication.  METHODS: At the Medical Center Hamburg‐Eppendorf, a tertiary care university hospital in Germany, 240 chronically ill inpatients with hypertension, diabetes, and/or dyslipidemia were enrolled in this prospective, semirandomized study. For the intervention group, hospital doctors were counseled by a clinical pharmacist on feasible simplifications of cardiovascular and antidiabetic medications. In 1 randomized subgroup, the PCP received additional explanatory information in the discharge letter. Adherence (self‐reporting using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale [MARS‐D]) and medication complexity (using the Medication Regimen Complexity Index [MRCI‐D]) were recorded at admission to the hospital, discharge from the hospital, and 6 weeks after discharge. Patient quality of life (QoL) and satisfaction with information about medications were assessed at admission and after discharge.   RESULTS: At discharge, the medication regimen in the intervention group was significantly less complex than in the comparison group. Yet, 6 weeks  after discharge, the complexity of the outpatient medication had increased to values similar to the comparison group, unless the PCP received additional information in the discharge letter. Propensity adjusted complete adherence rates at discharge were slightly, but not significantly, higher in the intervention group than in the comparison group. Within the intervention group, complete adherence was more frequent in the subgroup with additional information for the PCP. Patient QoL and satisfaction with information were comparable in both groups.   CONCLUSION: The complexity of cardiovascular and antidiabetic hospital medications can be reduced by counseling the hospital doctors. However, for a sustainable simplification of outpatient medication, the PCPs must receive explicit information about the modifications. Patient adherence was not significantly influenced by this intervention. To verify these results, further research with objective measures of adherence and in patients with other diseases is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients experience barriers that make it difficult to take cardiovascular disease (CVD)‐related medications as prescribed. The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) was a tailored behavioral pharmacist‐administered and telephone‐based intervention for reducing CVD risk. OBJECTIVES: To (a) describe patient‐reported barriers to taking their medication as prescribed and (b) evaluate patient‐level characteristics associated with reporting medication barriers. METHODS: We recruited patients receiving care at primary care clinics affiliated with Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Eligible patients were diagnosed with hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia that were poorly controlled (blood pressure of > 150/100 mmHg and/or low‐density lipoprotein value > 130 mg/dL). At the time of enrollment, patients completed an interview with 7 questions derived from a validated medication barriers measure. Patient characteristics and individual medication treatment barriers are described. Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the association between a medication barrier score and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Most patients (n = 428) were married or living with their partners (57%) and were men (85%) who were diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia (64%). The most commonly reported barriers were having too much medication to take (31%) and forgetting whether medication was taken at a particular time (24%). In adjusted analysis, those who were not employed (1.32, 95% CI = 0.50‐2.14) or did not have someone to help with tasks, if needed (1.66, 95% CI = 0.42‐2.89), reported higher medication barrier scores. Compared with those diagnosed with hypertension and hyperlipidemia, those with only hypertension (0.91, 95% CI = 0.04‐1.79) reported higher medication barrier scores. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to medication adherence are common. Evaluating and addressing barriers may increase medication adherence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe recommendations made by clinical pharmacists when co‐managing hypertension with physicians. SETTING: Two family medicine clinics at a major teaching hospital in the mid‐western United States. METHOD: This report details the specific recommendations made by pharmacists during a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension were enrolled in a 9‐month intensive pharmacist‐physician co‐management study. Clinical pharmacists saw patients at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 8 month visits. Optional visits were allowed between required visits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: For this analysis, pharmacist recommendations were grouped. Physician acceptance of the pharmacists' recommendations was also evaluated. RESULTS: Data from 101 patients were included and analyzed in this study. Changes in drug therapy were recommended 267 times for these 101 patients. Most recommendations for a change in treatment involved adding a new antihypertensive medication (46.4%) or increasing a dose (33.3%). The majority of pharmacist recommendations to modify drug therapy were made at the baseline visit (41.6%), with 76.8% of recommendations made by the 2 month visit. Physicians accepted and implemented 95.9% of the 267 pharmacist recommendations to modify drug therapy. Pharmacists recommended no change in the treatment plan 361 times, most often because the patient's blood pressure (BP) had achieved the goal. Average BP decreased from 153.1+/‐10.0/84.9+/‐12.0 mmHg (average+/‐SD) at baseline to 124.2+/‐9.7/74.7+/‐9.6 mmHg (P<0.001) at the end of 9 months, with 89.1% (P<0.001) of patients reaching their BP goal. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist recommendations for alterations in drug therapy generally occurred early in the course of the study and were largely to intensify therapy through higher dosages or additional medications. Pharmacist‐physician co‐management of BP is effective at reducing BP and improving BP control rates.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In patients with hypertension, medication adherence is often suboptimal, thereby increasing the risk of ischemic heart disease and stroke. In a randomized trial, we investigated the effectiveness of a multifaceted pharmacist intervention in a hospital setting to improve medication adherence in hypertensive patients. Motivational interviewing was a key element of the intervention. METHODS: Patients (n = 532) were recruited from 3 hospital outpatient clinics and randomized to usual care or a 6‐month pharmacist intervention comprising collaborative care, medication review, and tailored adherence counseling including motivational interviewing and telephone follow‐ups. The primary outcome was composite medication possession ratio (MPR) to antihypertensive and lipid‐lowering agents, at 1‐year follow‐up, assessed by analyzing pharmacy records. Secondary outcomes at 12 months included persistence to medications, blood pressure, hospital admission, and a combined clinical endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke, or acute myocardial infarction. RESULTS: At 12 months, 20.3% of the patients in the intervention group (n = 231) were nonadherent (MPR <0.80), compared with 30.2% in the control group (n = 285) (risk difference ‐9.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], ‐17.3, ‐2.4) and median MPR (interquartile range) was 0.93 (0.82‐0.99) and 0.91 (0.76‐0.98), respectively, P = .02. The combined clinical endpoint was reached by 1.3% in the intervention group and 3.1% in the control group (relative risk 0.41; 95% CI, 0.11‐1.50). No significant differences were found for persistence, blood pressure, or hospital admission. CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted pharmacist intervention in a hospital setting led to a sustained improvement in medication adherence for patients with hypertension. The intervention had no significant impact on blood pressure and secondary clinical outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a program of cooperation between physician and pharmacist to reduce cardiovascular risk factors in patients with mild to moderate hypertension by promoting better blood pressure (BP) control, appropriate changes in antihypertensive medications, and beneficial changes in lifestyle. METHODS: The 132 subjects in this randomized, controlled trial were in the age range of 40‐79 years. The inclusion criteria were: systolic BP (SBP) ranging from 140‐179 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) ranging from 90‐99 mm Hg and treatment‐naive (untreated for hypertension); or on a regimen of medication for hypertension. Of these 132 subjects, 124 (94%) were already receiving treatment with antihypertensive medications. Equal numbers of subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a physician‐pharmacist intervention group (n = 66) and a control group (n = 66). RESULTS: The 6‐month follow‐up rate was 97% in both groups. At 6 months, the mean decrease in SBP/DBP, as measured at home in the morning, was 2.9/3.3 mm Hg in the intervention group relative to baseline (P = 0.02 and P < 0.0001 for SBP and DBP, respectively). The mean decrease in home morning SBP in the intervention group was not significantly greater than in the control group. However, the DBP decline was significantly greater in the intervention than control groups, which showed a mean decrease of 2.8 mm Hg (confidence interval: ‐5.5 to ‐0.1; P = 0.04). The percentage of patients in whom control of home morning BP was achieved was 53% in the intervention group and 47% in the control group (P = 0.40). A higher percentage of patients in the intervention group, relative to the control group, were able to reduce the use of antihypertensive medications (31 vs. 8%, P < 0.0001), and fewer patients in this group required additional medications or increases in dosage relative to the controls (11 vs. 28%, P = 0.03). Patients of the intervention group were more likely to show reduction in body mass index and sodium intake and to stop smoking, as compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: A program of cooperation between physician and pharmacist was successful in reducing cardiovascular risk factors in patients with mild to moderate hypertension by promoting better blood pressure (BP) control, appropriate changes in antihypertensive medications, and beneficial changes in lifestyle.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate that pharmacists working with physicians and other providers in an ambulatory care setting can improve glucose, blood pressure, and lipid control for patients with type 2 diabetes and to report patient adherence to screening and general preventive measures. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, clinical practice study. SETTING: Burlington, MA, between January 2001 and August 2003. PATIENTS: 164 patients patients with type 2 diabetes older than 18 years with glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) greater than 8%. INTERVENTION: Pharmacist‐patient clinic visits included obtaining a comprehensive medication review; performing targeted physical assessment; ordering laboratory tests; reviewing, modifying, and monitoring patients' medication therapy and providing detailed counseling on all therapies; facilitating self‐monitoring of blood glucose; and providing reinforcement of dietary guidelines and exercise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Effect of clinical pharmacists working with physicians in an ambulatory setting on health measures (e.g., A1C, blood pressure, cholesterol) of patients with diabetes. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. After 1 year, significant improvements occurred for A1C and low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the intervention group compared with the control group (A1C, 7.7% vs. 8.4%; LDL, 93.7 vs. 105.1 mg/dL; P < 0.05). Systolic blood pressure improved for all study patients without a difference between the two groups. Diastolic blood pressure improved significantly in the intervention group compared with the control group (73.4 mm Hg vs. 77.6 mm Hg, P < 0.05). Significantly more intervention patients were screened for retinopathy, neuropathy, and microalbuminuria than control patients ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: For all indices measured, this study demonstrated that collaborative diabetes management with a clinical pharmacist can improve overall care.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Pay for performance is intended to align incentives to promote high‐quality care, but results have been contradictory. OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of explicit financial incentives to reward guideline‐recommended hypertension care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cluster randomized trial of 12 Veterans Affairs outpatient clinics with 5 performance periods and a 12‐month washout that enrolled 83 primary care physicians and 42 nonphysician personnel (eg, nurses, pharmacists). INTERVENTIONS: Physician‐level (individual) incentives, practice‐level incentives, both, or none. Intervention participants received up to 5 payments every 4 months; all participants could access feedback reports. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Among a random sample, number of patients achieving guideline‐recommended blood pressure thresholds or receiving an appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure, number of patients prescribed guideline‐recommended medications, and number who developed hypotension. RESULTS: Mean (SD) total payments over the study were $4270 ($459), $2672 ($153), and $1648 ($248) for the combined, individual, and practice‐level interventions, respectively. The unadjusted baseline and final percentages and the adjusted absolute change over the study in patients meeting the combined blood pressure/appropriate response measure were 75% to 84% and 8.84% (95% CI, 4.20% to 11.80%) for the individual group, 80% to 85% and 3.70% (95% CI, 0.24% to 7.68%) for the practice‐level group, 79% to 88% and 5.54% (95% CI, 1.92% to 9.52%) for the combined group, and 86% to 86% and 0.47% (95% CI, ‐3.12% to 4.04%) for the control group. The adjusted absolute estimated difference in the change between the proportion of patients with blood pressure control/appropriate response for individual incentive and control groups was 8.36% (95% CI, 2.40% to 13.00%; P=.005). The other incentive groups did not show a significant change compared with controls for this outcome. For medications, the unadjusted baseline and final percentages and the adjusted absolute change were 61% to 73% and 9.07% (95% CI, 4.52% to 13.44%), 56% to 65% and 4.98% (95% CI, 0.64% to 10.08%), 65% to 80% and 7.26% (95% CI, 2.92% to 12.48%), and 63% to 72% and 4.35% (95% CI, ‐0.28% to 9.28%), respectively. These changes in the use of guideline‐recommended medications were not significant in any of the incentive groups compared with controls, nor was the incidence of hypotension. The effect of the incentive was not sustained after a washout. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Individual financial incentives, but not practice‐level or combined incentives, resulted in greater blood pressure control or appropriate response to uncontrolled blood pressure; none of the incentives resulted in greater use of guideline‐recommended medications or increased incidence of hypotension compared with controls. Further research is needed on the factors that contributed to these findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00302718.

AB  - AIM: To determine the impact of adding pharmacists to primary care teams on predicted 10‐year risk of cardiovascular events in patients with Type 2 diabetes without established cardiovascular disease. METHODS: This was a pre‐specified secondary analysis of randomized trial data. The main study found that, compared with usual care, addition of a pharmacist resulted in improvements in blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, and hyperglycaemia for primary care patients with Type 2 diabetes. In this sub‐study, predicted 10‐year risk of cardiovascular events at baseline and 1 year were calculated for patients free of cardiovascular disease at enrolment. The primary outcome was change in UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk score; change in Framingham risk score was a secondary outcome. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between the 102 intervention patients and 93 control subjects: 59% women, median (interquartile range) age 57 (50‐64) years, diabetes duration 3 (1‐6.5) years, systolic blood pressure 128 (120‐140) mmHg, total cholesterol 4.34 (3.75‐5.04) mmol/l and HbA(1c) 54 mmol/mol (48‐64 mmol/mol) [7.1% (6.5‐8.0%)]. Median baseline UKPDS risk score was 10.2% (6.0‐16.7%) for intervention patients and 9.5% (5.8‐15.1%) for control subjects (P = 0.80). One‐year post‐randomization, the median absolute reduction in UKPDS risk score was 1.0% greater for intervention patients compared with control subjects (P = 0.032). Similar changes were seen with the Framingham risk score (median reduction 1.2% greater for intervention patients compared with control subjects, P = 0.048). The two risk scores were highly correlated (rho = 0.83; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Adding pharmacists to primary care teams for 1 year significantly reduced the predicted 10‐year risk of cardiovascular events for patients with Type 2 diabetes without established cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Hypertension is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and death worldwide. Advances in technology have added telemedicine as a tool for managing hypertension. The effectiveness of telemedicine depends on patients' ability to adhere to schedules of home monitoring and case management. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension in the intervention arm of a randomized trial who completed 6 months of follow‐up were included in this analysis. They were asked to measure their blood pressure (BP) a minimum of 6 times per week using a telemonitor that transmitted the readings to their pharmacist case manager. Hypertensive patients in this study had high adherence to telemonitoring (73% took at least 6 BP readings per week) and phone visits (88% of expected visits were attended). In a multivariate analysis, older age, male sex, and some college education predicted better telemonitoring adherence. White non‐Hispanic race/ethnicity predicted better adherence to phone visits with pharmacist case managers. Telemonitoring adherence and phone adherence were highly correlated; participants who did not send readings on schedule were more likely to skip at least one phone visit with their pharmacist case manager. The findings from this analysis indicate that hypertensive patients in this study were able to achieve and maintain high adherence to both the telemonitoring and the phone case management visits.

AB  - Effective interventions to identify and treat uncontrolled hypertension (HTN), particularly in underrepresented populations that use the emergency department (ED) for primary care, are critically needed. Uncontrolled HTN contributes significantly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is more frequently encountered among patients presenting to the ED as compared to the primary care setting. EDs serve as the point of entry into the health care system for high‐risk patient populations, including minority and low‐income patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of uncontrolled/undiagnosed HTN in patients presenting to the ED is alarmingly high. Thus ED engagement and early risk assessment/stratification is a feasible innovation to help close health disparity gaps in HTN. A Hypertension Emergency Department Intervention Aimed at Decreasing Disparities (AHEAD2) trial, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is a three‐arm single site randomized clinical pilot trial of adults presenting to the ED with Stage 2 hypertension (blood pressure [BP]>160/100) comparing (1) an ED‐initiated Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral for Treatment (SBIRT) focused on HTN, (2) the same ED‐initiated SBIRT coupled with a Post‐Acute Care Hypertension Transition Consultation by ED Clinical Pharmacists, and (3) usual care. The primary outcome is mean BP differences between study arms. Secondary outcomes are proportion of participants with BP control (BP<140/90mmHg), and improvements in HTN knowledge and medication adherence scores between study arms. The objective of this report is to describe the development of the AHEAD2 trial, including the methods, research infrastructure, and other features of the randomized clinical trial design.

AB  - Importance: Complex medication regimens pose self‐management challenges, particularly among populations with low levels of health literacy. Objective: To test medication management tools delivered through a commercial electronic health record (EHR) with and without a nurse‐led education intervention. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 3‐group cluster randomized clinical trial was performed in community health centers in Chicago, Illinois. Participants included 794 patients with hypertension who self‐reported using 3 or more medications concurrently (for any purpose). Data were collected from April 30, 2012, through February 29, 2016, and analyzed by intention to treat. Interventions: Clinics were randomly assigned to to groups: electronic health record‐based medication management tools (medication review sheets at visit check‐in, lay medication information sheets printed after visits; EHR‐alone group), EHR‐based tools plus nurse‐led medication management support (EHR plus education group), or usual care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes at 12 months included systolic blood pressure (primary outcome), medication reconciliation, knowledge of drug indications, understanding of medication instructions and dosing, and self‐reported medication adherence. Medication outcomes were assessed for all hypertension prescriptions, all prescriptions to treat chronic disease, and all medications. Results: Among the 794 participants (68.6% women; mean [SD] age, 52.7 [9.6] years), systolic blood pressure at 12 months was greater in the EHR‐alone group compared with the usual care group by 3.6 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.3 to 6.9 mm Hg). Systolic blood pressure in the EHR plus education group was not significantly lower compared with the usual care group (difference, ‐2.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, ‐5.2 to 1.3 mm Hg) but was lower compared with the EHR‐alone group (‐5.6 mm Hg; 95% CI, ‐8.8 to ‐2.4 mm Hg). At 12 months, hypertension medication reconciliation was improved in the EHR‐alone group (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.9) and the EHR plus education group (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.3) compared with usual care. Understanding of medication instructions and dosing was greater in the EHR plus education group than the usual care group for hypertension medications (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.8) and all medications combined (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.8). Compared with usual care, the EHR tools alone and EHR plus education interventions did not improve hypertension medication adherence (OR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6‐1.4 for both) or knowledge of chronic drug indications (OR for EHR tools alone, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.5] and OR for EHR plus education, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.7‐1.7]). Conclusions and Relevance: The study found that EHR tools in isolation improved medication reconciliation but worsened blood pressure. Combining these tools with nurse‐led support suggested improved understanding of medication instructions and dosing but did not lower blood pressure compared with usual care. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01578577.

AB  - WHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: With the increasing prevalence of diabetes, the physician‐centred model is challenged to deliver holistic care in Asia. Diabetes may be managed effectively within a multidisciplinary collaborative care model; however, evidence on its effectiveness in Asian patients is lacking. Therefore, the primary objective was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of multidisciplinary collaborative care vs physician‐centred care in diabetes. The secondary objectives were to evaluate humanistic and economic outcomes among the two types of care. METHODS: This 6‐month prospective, open‐label, parallel‐arm, randomized, controlled study was conducted at four outpatient healthcare institutions. High‐risk patients aged ≥21 years with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, polypharmacy and comorbidities were included. Patients with type 1 diabetes or those who were unable to communicate independently were excluded. The control arm received usual care with referrals to nurses and dietitians as needed. The intervention arm (multidisciplinary collaborative care) was followed up with pharmacists regularly, in addition to receiving the usual care. The primary outcomes included HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, low‐density lipoprotein and triglycerides. The secondary outcomes included scores from the Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) and the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaires (DTSQ), and diabetes‐related health service utilization rates and costs. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of 411 eligible patients, 214 and 197 patients were randomized into the intervention and control arms, respectively. At 6 months, 141 patients in the intervention arm (65.9%) and 189 patients in the control arm (95.9%) completed the study. Mean HbA1c reduced from 8.6%±1.5% at baseline to 8.1%±1.3% at 6 months in the intervention arm (P=.04), with up to mean HbA1c improvement of 0.8% in patients with greater levels of uncontrolled glycemia. Whereas the mean HbA1c in the control arm remained unchanged (8.5%±1.4%) throughout the 6‐month period. Improvements in PAID and DTSQ scores, reduction in physician workload and an average cost savings of US$91.01 per patient were observed in the intervention arm over 6 months. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSIONS: The positive clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes highlighted the value of multidisciplinary collaborative care for Asian diabetic patients, thereby supporting the effectiveness of this approach in managing chronic diseases.

T2  - Pharmacotherapy
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a medication management review (MMR) service on treatment‐related problems (TRPs) and certain clinical outcomes in outpatients. DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled study. SETTING: Two community pharmacies in Amman, Jordan. PATIENTS: A total of 160 people who visited the two community pharmacies between September 2009 and June 2010. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized into two groups: intervention (82 patients) and control (78 patients) groups. The clinical pharmacist conducted a baseline assessment MMR for patients in both groups to determine the prevalence and type of TRPs; however, recommendations regarding the identified TRPs were only submitted to the physicians of patients in the intervention group. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients were followed for an average of 3.39 months after their baseline visit to the pharmacy. The impact of the MMR service for the intervention group was assessed by evaluating the outcomes of the recommendations submitted by the clinical pharmacist to resolve the identified TRPs, physicians' acceptance of the recommended interventions, and the effect of the intervention on certain clinical outcomes: blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and triglyceride levels. Follow‐up assessment of the control group included evaluating the outcomes of the identified TRPs (identified and corrected by physicians without any input from the clinical pharmacist) and comparing glucose level, blood pressure, and triglyceride‐level results with baseline values. No significant differences in mean number of medical conditions (3.7 vs 3.42, p=0.134), mean number of medications (4.51 vs 4.96, p=0.135), or mean number of TRPs per patient (5.55 vs 5.17, p=0.42) were observed at baseline in the intervention group versus the control group. Follow‐up results revealed a high acceptance rate of recommendations by the physicians (94%). Regarding outcomes of TRPs, almost 70% of the identified TRPs in the intervention group were resolved or improved compared with 2% in the control group (p<0.001). Significant differences were found between the intervention group versus control group with regard to mean ± SD glucose levels (99.08 ± 9.66 vs 115.48 ± 17.34, p<0.001), blood pressure (110.36/81.55 ± 9.45/3.91 vs 125.0/88.73 ± 10.34/4.12, p<0.001), and triglyceride levels (148.53 ± 15.98 vs 170.74 ± 6.26, p=0.001). CONCLUSION: The MMR service resulted in a significantly lower number of TRPs and significantly improved clinical outcomes, and it was highly accepted by the physicians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Appropriate training for community pharmacists may improve the quality of medication use. Few studies have reported the impact of such programs on medication management for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, cluster‐randomized, controlled trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Patients with CKD stage 3a, 3b, or 4 from 6 CKD clinics (Quebec, Canada) and their community pharmacies. INTERVENTION: Each cluster (a pharmacy and its patients) was randomly assigned to either ProFiL, a training‐and‐communication network program, or the control group. ProFiL pharmacists completed a 90‐minute interactive web‐based training program on use of medications in CKD and received a clinical guide, patients' clinical summaries, and facilitated access to the CKD clinic. OUTCOMES: Drug‐related problems (primary outcome), pharmacists' knowledge and clinical skills, and patients' clinical attributes (eg, blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin concentration). MEASUREMENTS: Drug‐related problems were evaluated the year before and after the recruitment of patients using a validated set of significant drug‐related problems, the Pharmacotherapy Assessment in Chronic Renal Disease (PAIR) criteria. Pharmacists' questionnaires were completed at baseline and after 1 year. Clinical attributes were documented at baseline and after 1 year using available information in medical charts. RESULTS: 207 community pharmacies, 494 pharmacists, and 442 patients with CKD participated. After 1 year, the mean number of drug‐related problems per patient decreased from 2.16 to 1.60 and from 1.70 to 1.62 in the ProFiL and control groups, respectively. The difference in reduction of drug‐related problems per patient between the ProFiL and control groups was ‐0.32 (95% CI, ‐0.63 to ‐0.01). Improvements in knowledge (difference, 4.5%; 95% CI, 1.6%‐7.4%) and clinical competencies (difference, 7.4%; 95% CI, 3.5%‐11.3%) were observed among ProFiL pharmacists. No significant differences in clinical attributes were observed across the groups. LIMITATIONS: High proportion of missing data on knowledge and clinical skills questionnaire (34.6%) and clinical attributes (11.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Providing community pharmacists with essential clinical data, appropriate training, and support from hospital pharmacists with expertise in nephrology increases pharmacists' knowledge and reduces drug‐related problems in patients with CKD who are followed up in clinics incorporating a multidisciplinary health care team.

AB  - Background Pulmonary hypertension is a rare, chronic and life‐threatening group of diseases. Recent advances in pulmonary hypertension management prolong survival and improve quality‐of‐life. However, highly complex drug therapy enhances the risk of drug‐related problems. Objective To assess the impact of involving clinical pharmacists in the collaborative care of pulmonary hypertension patients. Setting Ten French University Hospital Pneumology departments, all members of the French Network for Pulmonary Hypertension. Methods This prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial included incident pulmonary hypertension patients who were followed‐up for 18Â months. Randomization using an adapted Zelen method allocated patients to collaborative care (n = 41) or usual care groups (n = 51). A collaborative care program involving clinical pharmacists was developed through a close partnership between with physicians, nurses and pharmacists. Besides usual care, the program includes regular one‐to‐one interviews between the pharmacist and the patient. These interviews had following objectives: to perform an exhaustive medication history review; to identify the patientâ€™ needs, knowledge and skills; to define educational objectives and to provide patients with relevant information when needed. Following each interview, a standardized report form containing the pharmacistâ€™s recommendations was provided to physicians and nurses and discussed collaboratively. An ancillary economic analysis was performed.Â Main outcome measure Number of drug‐related problems and their outcomes. Results The number of drug‐related problems was not significantly different between groups (1.6 Â± 1.5 vs. 1.9 Â± 2.4; p = 0.41). More problems were resolved in the collaborative care group than in the usual care group (86.5% vs. 66.7%, p = 0.01). Time to clinical worsening, therapeutic adherence, satisfaction or quality‐of‐life were not statistically different between groups. Collaborative care decreased costs of drug‐related hospitalizations. Conclusion Including clinical pharmacists in the multidisciplinary care of hospitalized patients with pulmonary hypertension improved the outcome of drug‐related problems and reduced the costs of related hospitalization. However, we observed no efficacy on medication errors, clinical outcomes or medication adherence. Clinical Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01038284.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are significant, but often preventable, contributors to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Medication and behavioral nonadherence are significant barriers to successful hypertension, hyperlidemia, and diabetes management. Our objective was to describe the theoretical framework underlying a tailored behavioral and educational pharmacist‐administered intervention for achieving CVD risk reduction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults with poorly controlled hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia were enrolled from three outpatient primary care clinics associated with the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Durham, NC). Participants were randomly assigned to receive a pharmacist‐administered, tailored, 1‐year telephone‐based intervention or usual care. The goal of the study was to reduce the risk for CVD through a theory‐driven intervention to increase medication adherence and improve health behaviors. RESULTS: Enrollment began in November 2011 and is ongoing. The target sample size is 500 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) intervention has been designed with a strong theoretical underpinning. The theoretical foundation and intervention are designed to encourage patients with multiple comorbidities and poorly controlled CVD risk factors to engage in home‐based monitoring and tailored telephone‐based interventions. Evidence suggests that clinical pharmacist‐administered telephone‐based interventions may be efficiently integrated into primary care for patients with poorly controlled CVD risk factors.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effectiveness of a diabetes virtual clinic to enhance diabetes in primary care by developing clinical management plans for patients with suboptimal metabolic control and/or case complexity. METHODS: A prospective study with randomized allocation to virtual clinic or usual care. Patients with Type 2 diabetes (n = 208) were recruited from six general practices in South London. The primary outcome for the study was glycaemic control, secondary outcomes included: lipids, blood pressure, weight (kg and BMI) and renal function (eGFR). Data were collected from participants' records at baseline and 12 months. We also considered process measures including therapy optimization. RESULTS: The 12‐month data show equivalence between the virtual clinic and control groups for glycaemic control with both achieving clinically significant reductions in HbA1c of 8 mmol/mol (0.6 ± 1.7%) and 10 mmol/mol (0.8 ± 1.9%), respectively (P = 0.4). The virtual clinic group showed superiority over the intervention group for blood pressure control with a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 6 ± 16 mmHg compared with an increased of 2 ± 18 mmHg in the control group (P = 0.008). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of cholesterol, weight and renal function. Process measures showed an increased level of therapy adjustment in the virtual clinic group. CONCLUSION: The virtual clinic model explored in this study showed a clinically important improvement in glycaemic control. Although this improvement was not superior to that observed in the control participants, this might be attributable to the systemic impact of the virtual clinic on the practice as a whole.

AB  - Antihypertensive drug adherence (ADA) is a mainstay in blood pressure control. Education through mobile phone short message system (SMS) text messaging could improve ADA. The authors conducted a randomized study involving 314 patients with hypertension with <6 months of antihypertensive treatment from the Preventive Health Program of 12 different primary care centers in Santiago, Chile. Patients were randomly assigned to receive or not receive SMS related to ADA and healthy lifestyle. Adherence was assessed by the self‐reported four‐item scale Morisky‐Green‐Levine questionnaire at baseline and after 6 months of follow‐up, with four of four positive questions classified as good adherence. Group comparison for adherence was performed by means of a logistic regression model, adjusting by baseline adherence, age older than 60 years, and sex. A total of 163 patients were randomized to receive and 151 to not receive SMS. After 6 months of follow‐up, ADA in the non‐SMS group decreased from 59.3% to 51.4% (P=.1). By contrast, adherence increased from 49% to 62.3% (P=.01) in the SMS group. Text messaging intervention improved ADA (risk ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.0‐1.6 [P<.05]). At 6‐month follow‐up, text messaging resulted in an increase in reporting ADA in this hypertensive Latino population. This approach could become an effective tool to overcome poor medication adherence in the community.

AB  - PURPOSE: Rural low‐income African American patients with diabetes have traditionally poorer clinical outcomes and limited access to state‐of‐the‐art diabetes care. We determined the effectiveness of a redesigned primary care model on patients' glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid level control. METHODS: In 3 purposively selected, rural, fee‐for‐service, primary care practices, African American patients with type 2 diabetes received point‐of‐care education, coaching, and medication intensification from a diabetes care management team made up of a nurse, pharmacist, and dietitian. In 5 randomly selected control practices matched for practice and patient characteristics, African American patients received usual care. Using univariate and multivariate adjusted models, we evaluated the effects of the intervention on intermediate (median 18 months) and long‐term (median 36 months) changes in glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c) levels, blood pressure, and lipid levels, as well as the proportion of patients meeting target values. RESULTS: Among 727 randomly selected rural African American diabetic patients (368 intervention, 359 control), intervention patients had a significantly greater reduction in mean hemoglobin A1c levels at intermediate (‐0.5 % vs ‐0.2%; P <.05) and long‐term (‐0.5% vs ‐0.10%; P <.005) follow‐up in univariate and multivariate models. The proportion of patients achieving a hemoglobin A1c level of less than 7.5% (68% vs 59%, P <.01) and/or a systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg (69% vs 57%, P <.01) was also significantly greater in intervention practices in multivariate models. CONCLUSION: Redesigning care strategies in rural fee‐for‐service primary care practices for African American patients with established diabetes results in significantly improved glycemic control relative to usual care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether provision of fixed dose combination treatment improves adherence and risk factor control compared with usual care of patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease in primary care. DESIGN: Open label randomised control trial: IMPACT (IMProving Adherence using Combination Therapy). SETTING: 54 general practices in the Auckland and Waikato regions of New Zealand, July 2010 to August 2013. PARTICIPANTS: 513 adults (including 257 indigenous Māori) at high risk of cardiovascular disease (established cardiovascular disease or five year risk ≥ 15%) who were recommended for treatment with antiplatelet, statin, and two or more blood pressure lowering drugs. 497 (97%) completed 12 months' follow‐up. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to continued usual care or to fixed dose combination treatment (with two versions available: aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, and lisinopril 10 mg with either atenolol 50 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg). All drugs in both treatment arms were prescribed by their usual general practitioners and dispensed by local community pharmacists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were self reported adherence to recommended drugs (antiplatelet, statin, and two or more blood pressure lowering agents) and mean change in blood pressure and low density lipoprotein cholesterol at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Among this well treated primary care population, fixed dose combination treatment improved adherence to the combination of all recommended drugs but improvements in clinical risk factors were small and did not reach statistical significance. Acceptability was high for both general practitioners and patients, although the discontinuation rate was high. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry ACTRN12606000067572. RESULTS: Adherence to all four recommended drugs was greater among fixed dose combination than usual care participants at 12 months (81% v 46%; relative risk 1.75, 95% confidence interval 1.52 to 2.03, P<0.001; number needed to treat 2.9, 95% confidence interval 2.3 to 3.7). Adherence for each drug type at 12 months was high in both groups but especially in the fixed dose combination group: for antiplatelet treatment it was 93% fixed dose combination v 83% usual care (P<0.001), for statin 94% v 89% (P=0.06), for combination blood pressure lowering 89% v 59% (P<0.001), and for any blood pressure lowering 96% v 91% (P=0.02). Self reported adherence was highly concordant with dispensing data (dispensing of all four recommended drugs 79% fixed dose combination v 47% usual care, relative risk 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.44 to 1.93, P<0.001). There was no statistically significant improvement in risk factor control between the fixed dose combination and usual care groups over 12 months: the difference in systolic blood pressure was ‐2.2 mm Hg (‐4.5 v ‐2.3, 95% confidence interval ‐5.6 to 1.2, P=0.21), in diastolic blood pressure ‐1.2 mm Hg (‐2.1 v ‐0.9, ‐3.2 to 0.8, P=0.22) and in low density lipoprotein cholesterol ‐0.05 mmol/L (‐0.20 v ‐0.15, ‐0.17 to 0.08, P=0.46). The number of participants with cardiovascular events or serious adverse events was similar in both treatment groups (fixed dose combination 16 v usual care 18 (P=0.73), 99 v 93 (P=0.56), respectively). Fixed dose combination treatment was discontinued in 94 participants (37%). The most commonly reported reason for discontinuation was a side effect (54/75, 72%). Overall, 89% (227/256) of fixed dose combination participants' general practitioners completed a post‐trial survey, and the fixed dose combination strategy was rated as satisfactory or very satisfactory for starting treatment (206/227, 91%), blood pressure control (180/220, 82%), cholesterol control (170/218, 78%), tolerability (181/223, 81%), and prescribing according to local guidelines (185/219, 84%). When participants were asked at 12 months how easy they found taking their prescribed drugs, most responded very easy or easy (224/246, 91% fixed dose combination v 212/246, 86% usual care, P=0.09). At 12 months the change in other lipid fractions, difference in EuroQol‐5D, and difference in barriers to adherence did not differ significantly between the treatment groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lack of timely medication intensification and inadequate medication safety monitoring are two prevalent and potentially modifiable barriers to effective and safe chronic care. Innovative applications of health information technology tools may help support chronic disease management. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical impact of a novel health IT tool designed to facilitate between‐visit ordering and tracking of future laboratory testing. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Clinical trial randomized at the provider level (n = 44 primary care physicians); patient‐level outcomes among 3,655 primary care patients prescribed 5,454 oral medicines for hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and/or hypertension management over a 12‐month period. MAIN MEASURES: Time from prescription to corresponding follow‐up laboratory testing; proportion of follow‐up time that patients achieved corresponding risk factor control (A1c, LDL); adverse event laboratory monitoring 4 weeks after medicine prescription. KEY RESULTS: Patients whose physicians were allocated to the intervention (n = 1,143) had earlier LDL laboratory assessment compared to similar patients (n = 703) of control physicians [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.15 (1.01‐1.32), p = 0.04]. Among patients with elevated LDL (486 intervention, 324 control), there was decreased time to LDL goal in the intervention group [aHR 1.26 (0.99‐1.62)]. However, overall there were no significant differences between study arms in time spent at LDL or HbA1c goal. Follow‐up safety monitoring (e.g., creatinine, potassium, or transaminases) was relatively infrequent (ranging from 7 % to 29 % at 4 weeks) and not statistically different between arms. Intervention physicians indicated that lack of reimbursement for non‐visit‐based care was a barrier to use of the tool. CONCLUSIONS: A health IT tool to support between‐visit laboratory monitoring improved the LDL testing interval but not LDL or HbA1c control, and it did not alter safety monitoring. Adoption of innovative tools to support physicians in non‐visit‐based chronic disease management may be limited by current visit‐based financial and productivity incentives.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic conditions often use complex medical regimens. A nurse‐led strategy to support medication therapy management incorporated into primary care teams may lead to improved use of medications for disease control. Electronic health record (EHR) tools may offer a lower‐cost, less intensive approach to improving medication management. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Northwestern and Access Community Health Network Medication Education Study is a health center‐level cluster‐randomized trial being conducted within a network of federally qualified community health centers. Health centers have been enrolled in groups of 3 and randomized to (1) usual care, (2) EHR‐based medication management tools alone, or (3) EHR tools plus nurse‐led medication therapy management. Patients with uncontrolled hypertension who are prescribed ≥ 3 medications of any kind are recruited from the centers. EHR tools include a printed medication list to prompt review at each visit and automated plain‐language medication information within the after‐visit summary to encourage proper medication use. In the nurse‐led intervention, patients receive one‐on‐one counseling about their medication regimens to clarify medication discrepancies and identify drug‐related concerns, safety issues, and nonadherence. Nurses also provide follow‐up telephone calls following new prescriptions and periodically to perform medication review. The primary study outcome is systolic blood pressure after 1 year. Secondary outcomes include measures of understanding of dosing instructions, discrepancies between patient‐reported medications and the medical record, adherence, and intervention costs. CONCLUSIONS: The Northwestern and Access Community Health Network Medication Education Study will assess the effects of 2 approaches to support outpatient medication management among patients with uncontrolled hypertension in federally qualified health center settings.

AB  - Discontinuation of angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is recommended if patients experience ≥30% acute increase in serum creatinine after starting this therapy. However, the long‐term effects of its continuation or discontinuation on major clinical outcomes after increases in serum creatinine are unclear. In the ADVANCE trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation), 11 140 diabetes mellitus patients were randomly assigned to perindopril‐indapamide or placebo after a 6‐week active run‐in period. The current study included 11 066 participants with 2 serum creatinine measurements recorded before and during the active run‐in period (3 weeks apart). Acute increase in creatinine was determined using these 2 measurements and classified into 4 groups: increases in serum creatinine of <10%, 10% to 19%, 20% to 29%, and ≥30%. The primary study outcome was the composite of major macrovascular events, new or worsening nephropathy, and all‐cause mortality. An acute increase in serum creatinine was associated with an elevated risk of the primary outcome ( P for trend <0.001). The hazard ratios were 1.11 (95% CI, 0.97‐1.28) for those with an increase of 10% to 19%, 1.34 (1.07‐1.66) for 20% to 29%, and 1.44 (1.15‐1.81) for ≥30%, compared with <10%. However, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in the benefit of randomized treatment effects on the outcome across subgroups defined by acute serum creatinine increase ( P for heterogeneity=0.94). Acute increases in serum creatinine after starting perindopril‐indapamide were associated with greater risks of subsequent major clinical outcomes. However, the continuation of angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor‐based therapy reduced the long‐term risk of major clinical outcomes, irrespective of acute increase in creatinine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In resource‐poor areas of China and India, the cardiovascular disease burden is high, but availability of and access to quality healthcare is limited. Establishing a management scheme that utilizes the local infrastructure and builds healthcare capacity is essential for cardiovascular disease prevention and management. The study aims to develop, implement, and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a simplified, evidence‐based cardiovascular management program delivered by community healthcare workers in resource‐constrained areas in Tibet, China and Haryana, India. METHODS/DESIGN: This yearlong cluster‐randomized controlled trial will be conducted in 20 villages in Tibet and 20 villages in Haryana. Randomization of villages to usual care or intervention will be stratified by country. High cardiovascular disease risk individuals (aged 40 years or older, history of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or measured systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg or higher) will be screened at baseline. Community health workers in the intervention villages will be trained to manage and follow up high‐risk patients on a monthly basis following a simplified '2+2' intervention model involving two lifestyle recommendations and the appropriate prescription of two medications. A customized electronic decision support system based on the intervention strategy will be developed to assist the community health workers with patient management. Baseline and follow‐up surveys will be conducted in a standardized fashion in all villages. The primary outcome will be the net difference between‐group in the proportion of high‐risk patients taking antihypertensive medication pre‐ and post‐intervention. Secondary outcomes will include the proportion of patients taking aspirin and changes in blood pressure. Process and economic evaluations will also be conducted. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be the first study to evaluate the effect of a simplified management program delivered by community health workers with the help of electronic decision support system on improving the health of high cardiovascular disease risk patients. If effective, this intervention strategy can serve as a model that can be implemented, where applicable, in rural China, India, and other resource‐constrained areas. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database on 30 December, 2011 and the registration number is NCT01503814.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite well‐publicized guidelines on the appropriate management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, implementation of risk‐reducing practices remains poor. This paper describes the rationale and design of a randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness of a comprehensive program of CVD risk reduction delivered by nurse practitioner (NP)/community health worker (CHW) teams versus enhanced usual care in improving the proportion of patients in urban community health centers who achieve goal levels recommended by national guidelines for lipids, blood pressure, HbA1c and prescription of appropriate medications. METHODS: The COACH (Community Outreach and Cardiovascular Health) trial is a randomized controlled trial in which patients at federally‐qualified community health centers were randomly assigned to one of two groups: comprehensive intensive management of CVD risk factors for one year by a NP/CHW team or an enhanced usual care control group. RESULTS: A total of 3899 patients were assessed for eligibility and 525 were randomized. Groups were comparable at baseline on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with the exception of statistically significant differences in total cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c. CONCLUSIONS: This study is a novel amalgam of multilevel interdisciplinary strategies to translate highly efficacious therapies to low‐income federally‐funded health centers that care for patients who carry a disproportionate burden of CVD, type 2 diabetes and uncontrolled CVD risk factors. The impact of such a community clinic‐based intervention is potentially enormous.

AB  - TRIAL DESIGN: to further validate the FORTA (Fit fOR The Aged) concept, a bicentric randomised, controlled trial was run in two geriatric clinics. METHODS: patients (≥65 years, ≥3 drugs or ≥60 years, ≥6 drugs) with three relevant diseases and hospitalisation for ≥5 days were randomised. In the intervention, but not the control group, a FORTA team instructed ward physicians on FORTA. FORTA is the first positive/negative listing approach labelling medications used to treat chronic illnesses in older patients from A (indispensable), B (beneficial), C (questionable) to D (avoid). The primary end point was the FORTA score: sum of medication errors classified as over‐, under‐ and mistreatment. Consecutive patients were randomised to the intervention and control ward; outcome assessment was blinded. RESULTS: four hundred and nine patients (age 81.5 years, 64% female, hospitalisation 17.4 days) were included. The primary end point was significantly (P < 0.0001) more reduced in the intervention versus control groups (2.7 ± 2.25 versus 1 ± 1.8, mean ± SD, intergroup comparison of admission/discharge differences). Over‐ and under‐treatment scores and use of A (increase) and D (decrease) drugs were significantly improved (P < 0.01). The total number of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was significantly reduced by FORTA (P < 0.05, number needed to treat is 5). Activities of daily living and renal failure improved significantly (P < 0.05). Blood pressure remained constant in the intervention, but decreased significantly in the control group. CONCLUSION: applying FORTA to hospitalised geriatric patients leads to improvement of medication quality and may improve secondary clinical end points (e.g. ADRs). The concept is amenable to successful communication and implementation. Registration (DRKS‐ID): DRKS00000531. FUNDING: DFG‐German Research Foundation (WE 1184/15‐1).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment nonadherence and clinical inertia perpetuate poor cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor control. Telemedicine interventions may counter both treatment nonadherence and clinical inertia. INTRODUCTION: We explored why a telemedicine intervention designed to reduce treatment nonadherence and clinical inertia did not improve CVD risk factor control, despite enhancing treatment adherence versus usual care. METHODS: In this analysis of a randomized trial, we studied recipients of the 12‐month telemedicine intervention. This intervention comprised two nurse‐administered components: (1) monthly self‐management education targeting improved treatment adherence; and (2) quarterly medication management facilitation designed to support treatment intensification by primary care (thereby reducing clinical inertia). For each medication management facilitation encounter, we ascertained whether patients met treatment goals, and if not, whether primary care recommended treatment intensification following the encounter. We assessed disease control associated with encounters, where intensification was/was not recommended. RESULTS: We examined 455 encounters across 182 intervention recipients (100% African Americans with type 2 diabetes). Even after accounting for valid reasons for deferring intensification (e.g., treatment nonadherence), intensification was not recommended in 67.5% of encounters in which hemoglobin A1c was above goal, 72.5% in which systolic blood pressure was above goal, and 73.9% in which low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol was above goal. In each disease state, treatment intensification was more likely with poorer control. CONCLUSIONS: Despite enhancing treatment adherence, this intervention was unsuccessful in countering clinical inertia, likely explaining its lack of effect on CVD risk factors. We identify several lessons learned that may benefit investigators and healthcare systems.

T2  - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
AB  - Abstract - Background This review focuses on non‐dispensing services from pharmacists, i.e. pharmacists in community, primary or ambulatory‐care settings, to non‐hospitalised patients, and is an update of a previously‐published Cochrane Review. Objectives To examine the effect of pharmacists' non‐dispensing services on non‐hospitalised patient outcomes. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trial registers in March 2015, together with reference checking and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. We included non‐English language publications. We ran top‐up searches in January 2018 and have added potentially eligible studies to 'Studies awaiting classification'. Selection criteria Randomised trials of pharmacist services compared with the delivery of usual care or equivalent/similar services with the same objective delivered by other health professionals. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures of Cochrane and the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group. Two review authors independently checked studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risks of bias. We evaluated the overall certainty of evidence using GRADE. Main results We included 116 trials comprising 111 trials (39,729 participants) comparing pharmacist interventions with usual care and five trials (2122 participants) comparing pharmacist services with services from other healthcare professionals. Of the 116 trials, 76 were included in meta‐analyses. The 40 remaining trials were not included in the meta‐analyses because they each reported unique outcome measures which could not be combined. Most trials targeted chronic conditions and were conducted in a range of settings, mostly community pharmacies and hospital outpatient clinics, and were mainly but not exclusively conducted in high‐income countries. Most trials had a low risk of reporting bias and about 25%‐30% were at high risk of bias for performance, detection, and attrition. Selection bias was unclear for about half of the included studies. Compared with usual care, we are uncertain whether pharmacist services reduce the percentage of patients outside the glycated haemoglobin target range (5 trials, N = 558, odds ratio (OR) 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 2.22; very low‐certainty evidence). Pharmacist services may reduce the percentage of patients whose blood pressure is outside the target range (18 trials, N = 4107, OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.55; low‐certainty evidence) and probably lead to little or no difference in hospital attendance or admissions (14 trials, N = 3631, OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.11; moderate‐certainty evidence). Pharmacist services may make little or no difference to adverse drug effects (3 trials, N = 590, OR 1.65, 95% CI 0.84 to 3.24) and may slightly improve physical functioning (7 trials, N = 1329, mean difference (MD) 5.84, 95% CI 1.21 to 10.48; low‐certainty evidence). Pharmacist services may make little or no difference to mortality (9 trials, N = 1980, OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.12, low‐certaintly evidence). Of the five studies that compared services delivered by pharmacists with other health professionals, no studies evaluated the impact of the intervention on the percentage of patients outside blood pressure or glycated haemoglobin target range, hospital attendance and admission, adverse drug effects, or physical functioning. Authors' conclusions The results demonstrate that pharmacist services have varying effects on patient outcomes compared with usual care. We found no studies comparing services delivered by pharmacists with other healthcare professionals that evaluated the impact of the intervention on the six main outcome measures. The results need to be interpreted cautiously because there was major heterogeneity in study populations, types of interventions delivered and reported outcomes.There was considerable heterogeneity within many of the meta‐analyses, as well as considerable variation in the risks of bias. Plain language summary Can services delivered by pharmacists improve patient health? What is the aim of this review? To test whether services provided by pharmacists improve patient health. We identified 116 studies to answer this question. Key messages Some services provided by pharmacists can have positive effects on patient health, including improved management of blood pressure and physical function. The pharmacist services did not reduce hospital visits or admissions. Services delivered by pharmacists produced similar effects on patient health compared with services delivered by other healthcare professionals. What was studied in the review? Pharmacists deliver a wide range of services to patients. We need to know which pharmacist services are effective in helping patients to improve their health. This review included studies of pharmacist services for a wide range of conditions including high blood pressure and diabetes. The review measured the effect of these services on benefits (improved health outcomes) as well as harms (unplanned hospital admissions, adverse drug effects). What are the main results of the review? We found 116 relevant studies which involved 41,851 participants. Studies were conducted in 25 countries with the USA, UK, Canada and Australia contributing most studies. Many were conducted in community pharmacies (chemist shops) and hospital outpatient clinics. The studies compared services delivered by pharmacists with either usual care or with care delivered by other health professionals. The studies were of overall high quality, although some had problems because they did not include all the relevant information needed to assess quality. Of the 111 studies that compared pharmacist services with usual care, 47 studies reported the most important outcomes. Compared with usual care, pharmacist services may reduce the percentage of patients whose blood pressure is outside the target range. It is uncertain whether services delivered by pharmacists reduce the number of patients with glycated haemoglobin levels outside the target range, because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Pharmacist services may make little or no difference to hospital attendance or admissions or to adverse drug effects or to death rates. Pharmacist services may slightly improve physical functioning. We found no studies comparing services delivered by pharmacists with other healthcare professionals that evaluated the impact of the intervention on the six main outcome measures. How up‐to‐date is this review? We searched for studies that had been published up to March 2015. We ran top‐up searches in January 2018 and have added potentially eligible studies to 'Studies awaiting classification'.

AB  - Abstract - Background The roles of pharmacists in patient care have expanded from the traditional tasks of dispensing medications and providing basic medication counseling to working with other health professionals and the public. Multiple reviews have evaluated the impact of pharmacist‐provided patient care on health‐related outcomes. Prior reviews have primarily focused on in‐patient settings. This systematic review focuses on services provided by outpatient pharmacists in community or ambulatory care settings. This is an update of the Cochrane review published in 2000. Objectives To examine the effect of outpatient pharmacists' non‐dispensing roles on patient and health professional outcomes. Search methods This review has been split into two phases. For Phase I, we searched the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register (January 1966 through March 2007). For Phase II, we searched MEDLINE/EMBASE (January 1966 through March 2008). The Phase I results are reported in this review; Phase II will be summarized in the next update. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials comparing 1. Pharmacist services targeted at patients versus services delivered by other health professionals; 2. Pharmacist services targeted at patients versus the delivery of no comparable service; 3. Pharmacist services targeted at health professionals versus services delivered by other health professionals; 4. Pharmacist services targeted at health professionals versus the delivery of no comparable service. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently reviewed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included studies. Main results Forty‐three studies were included; 36 studies were pharmacist interventions targeting patients and seven studies were pharmacist interventions targeting health professionals. For comparison 1, the only included study showed a significant improvement in systolic blood pressure for patients receiving medication management from a pharmacist compared to usual care from a physician. For comparison 2, in the five studies evaluating process of care outcomes, pharmacist services reduced the incidence of therapeutic duplication and decreased the total number of medications prescribed. Twenty‐nine of 36 studies reported clinical and humanistic outcomes. Pharmacist interventions resulted in improvement in most clinical outcomes, although these improvements were not always statistically significant. Eight studies reported patient quality of life outcomes; three studies showed improvement in at least three subdomains. For comparison 3, no studies were identified meeting the inclusion criteria. For comparison 4, two of seven studies demonstrated a clear statistically significant improvement in prescribing patterns. Authors' conclusions Only one included study compared pharmacist services with other health professional services, hence we are unable to draw conclusions regarding comparisons 1 and 3. Most included studies supported the role of pharmacists in medication/therapeutic management, patient counseling, and providing health professional education with the goal of improving patient process of care and clinical outcomes, and of educational outreach visits on physician prescribing patterns. There was great heterogeneity in the types of outcomes measured across all studies. Therefore a standardized approach to measure and report clinical, humanistic, and process outcomes for future randomized controlled studies evaluating the impact of outpatient pharmacists is needed. Heterogeneity in study comparison groups, outcomes, and measures makes it challenging to make generalised statements regarding the impact of pharmacists in specific settings, disease states, and patient populations. Plain language summary Non‐traditional roles of outpatient pharmacists. The role of pharmacists in the community includes more than dispensing medications. It involves identifying, preventing, and resolving drug‐related problems, as well as encouraging proper use of medications and general health promotion and education. This review found forty‐three studies which evaluated non‐traditional roles of pharmacists. In general, the data included in this review supported the roles of pharmacists in patient counseling, therapeutic management, and providing health professional education with the goal of improving patient process of care and clinical outcomes. Non‐traditional roles of outpatient pharmacists improves health care outcomes. The data show that educational outreach visits may impact physician prescribing patterns.

T2  - Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
AB  - Abstract - Background A range of health workforce strategies are needed to address health service demands in low‐, middle‐ and high‐income countries. Non‐medical prescribing involves nurses, pharmacists, allied health professionals, and physician assistants substituting for doctors in a prescribing role, and this is one approach to improve access to medicines. Objectives To assess clinical, patient‐reported, and resource use outcomes of non‐medical prescribing for managing acute and chronic health conditions in primary and secondary care settings compared with medical prescribing (usual care). Search methods We searched databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and five other databases on 19 July 2016. We also searched the grey literature and handsearched bibliographies of relevant papers and publications. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster‐RCTs, controlled before‐and‐after (CBA) studies (with at least two intervention and two control sites) and interrupted time series analysis (with at least three observations before and after the intervention) comparing: 1. non‐medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in acute care; 2. non‐medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in chronic care; 3. non‐medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in secondary care; 4 non‐medical prescribing versus medical prescribing in primary care; 5. comparisons between different non‐medical prescriber groups; and 6. non‐medical healthcare providers with formal prescribing training versus those without formal prescribing training. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently reviewed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed study quality with discrepancies resolved by discussion. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias for the included studies according to EPOC criteria. We undertook meta‐analyses using the fixed‐effect model where studies were examining the same treatment effect and to account for small sample sizes. We compared outcomes to a random‐effects model where clinical or statistical heterogeneity existed. Main results We included 46 studies (37,337 participants); non‐medical prescribing was undertaken by nurses in 26 studies and pharmacists in 20 studies. In 45 studies non‐medical prescribing as a component of care was compared with usual care medical prescribing. A further study compared nurse prescribing supported by guidelines with usual nurse prescribing care. No studies were found with non‐medical prescribing being undertaken by other health professionals. The education requirement for non‐medical prescribing varied with country and location. A meta‐analysis of surrogate markers of chronic disease (systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, and low‐density lipoprotein) showed positive intervention group effects. There was a moderate‐certainty of evidence for studies of blood pressure at 12 months (mean difference (MD) ‐5.31 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐6.46 to ‐4.16; 12 studies, 4229 participants) and low‐density lipoprotein (MD ‐0.21, 95% CI ‐0.29 to ‐0.14; 7 studies, 1469 participants); we downgraded the certainty of evidence from high due to considerations of serious inconsistency (considerable heterogeneity), multifaceted interventions, and variable prescribing autonomy. A high‐certainty of evidence existed for comparative studies of glycated haemoglobin management at 12 months (MD ‐0.62, 95% CI ‐0.85 to ‐0.38; 6 studies, 775 participants). While there appeared little difference in medication adherence across studies, a meta‐analysis of continuous outcome data from four studies showed an effect favouring patient adherence in the non‐medical prescribing group (MD 0.15, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.30; 4 studies, 700 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for adherence to moderate due to the serious risk of performance bias. While little difference was seen in patient‐related adverse events between treatment groups, we downgraded the certainty of evidence to low due to indirectness, as the range of adverse events may not be related to the intervention and selective reporting failed to adequately report adverse events in many studies. Patients were generally satisfied with non‐medical prescriber care (14 studies, 7514 participants). We downgraded the certainty of evidence from high to moderate due to indirectness, in that satisfaction with the prescribing component of care was only addressed in one study, and there was variability of satisfaction measures with little use of validated tools. A meta‐analysis of health‐related quality of life scores (SF‐12 and SF‐36) found a difference favouring non‐medical prescriber care for the physical component score (MD 1.17, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.17), and the mental component score (MD 0.58, 95% CI ‐0.40 to 1.55). However, the quality of life measurement may more appropriately reflect composite care rather than the prescribing component of care, and for this reason we downgraded the certainty of evidence to moderate due to indirectness of the measure of effect. A wide variety of resource use measures were reported across studies with little difference between groups for hospitalisations, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits. In the majority of studies reporting medication use, non‐medical prescribers prescribed more drugs, intensified drug doses, and used a greater variety of drugs compared to usual care medical prescribers. The risk of bias across studies was generally low for selection bias (random sequence generation), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), and reporting bias (selective reporting). There was an unclear risk of selection bias (allocation concealment) and for other biases. A high risk of performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel) existed. Authors' conclusions The findings suggest that non‐medical prescribers, practising with varying but high levels of prescribing autonomy, in a range of settings, were as effective as usual care medical prescribers. Non‐medical prescribers can deliver comparable outcomes for systolic blood pressure, glycated haemoglobin, low‐density lipoprotein, medication adherence, patient satisfaction, and health‐related quality of life. It was difficult to determine the impact of non‐medical prescribing compared to medical prescribing for adverse events and resource use outcomes due to the inconsistency and variability in reporting across studies. Future efforts should be directed towards more rigorous studies that can clearly identify the clinical, patient‐reported, resource use, and economic outcomes of non‐medical prescribing, in both high‐income and low‐income countries. Plain language summary Prescribing roles for health professionals other than doctors What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane review was to find out if prescribing by health professionals other than doctors delivers comparable outcomes to prescribing by doctors. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 46 studies. Key messages With appropriate training and support, nurses and pharmacists are able to prescribe medicines as part of managing a range of conditions to achieve comparable health management outcomes to doctors. The majority of studies focus on chronic disease management in higher‐income counties where there is generally a moderate‐certainty of evidence supporting similar outcomes for the markers of disease in high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol. Further high‐quality studies are needed in poorer countries and to better quantify differences in prescribing outcomes for adverse events, and to determine health economic outcomes. Further studies could also focus more specifically on the prescribing component of care. What was studied in the review? A number of countries allow health professionals other than doctors to prescribe medicines. This shift in roles is thought to provide improved and timely access to medicines for consumers where there are shortages of doctors or the health system is facing pressures in coping with the burden of disease. In addition, this task shift has been supported by a number of governments as a way to more appropriately use the skills of health professionals, such as nurses and pharmacists, in the care of patients. We compared the outcomes of any healthcare workers who were prescribing with a high degree of autonomy with medical prescribers in the hospital or community setting in low‐, middle‐ and high‐income countries. What are the main results of the review? This review found 45 studies where nurses and pharmacists with high levels of prescribing autonomy were compared with usual care medical prescribers. A further study compared nurse prescribing with guideline support with usual nurse prescribing care. No studies were found with other health professionals or lay prescribers. Four nurse prescribing studies were undertaken in the low‐ and middle‐income settings of Colombia, South Africa, Uganda, and Thailand. The remainder of studies were undertaken in high‐income Western countries. Forty‐two studies were based in a community setting, two studies were located in hospitals, one study in the workplace, and one study in an aged care facility. Prescribing was but one part of many health‐related interventions, particularly in the management of chronic disease. The review found that the outcomes for non‐medical prescribers were comparable to medical prescribers for: high blood pressure (moderate‐certainty of evidence); diabetes control (high‐certainty of evidence); high cholesterol (moderate‐certainty of evidence); adverse events (low‐certainty of evidence); patients adhering to their medication regimens (moderate‐certainty of evidence); patient satisfaction with care (moderate‐certainty of evidence); and health‐related quality of life (moderate‐certainty of evidence). Pharmacists and nurses with varying levels of undergraduate, postgraduate, and specific on‐the‐job training related to the disease or condition were able to deliver comparable prescribing outcomes to doctors. Non‐medical prescribers frequently had medical support available to facilitate a collaborative practice model. How up‐to‐date is this review? The review authors searched for studies that had been published up to 19th July 2016.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lipid-lowering drugs are widely underused, despite strong evidence indicating they improve cardiovascular end points. Poor patient adherence to a medication regimen can affect the success of lipid-lowering treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions aimed at improving adherence to lipid-lowering drugs, focusing on measures of adherence and clinical outcomes.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL up to 3 February 2016, and clinical trials registers (ANZCTR and ClinicalTrials.gov) up to 27 July 2016. We applied no language restrictions.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We evaluated randomised controlled trials of adherence-enhancing interventions for lipid-lowering medication in adults in an ambulatory setting with a variety of measurable outcomes, such as adherence to treatment and changes to serum lipid levels. Two teams of review authors independently selected the studies.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors extracted and assessed data, following criteria outlined by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADEPro.
MAIN RESULTS: For this updated review, we added 24 new studies meeting the eligibility criteria to the 11 studies from prior updates. We have therefore included 35 studies, randomising 925,171 participants. Seven studies including 11,204 individuals compared adherence rates of those in an intensification of a patient care intervention (e.g. electronic reminders, pharmacist-led interventions, healthcare professional education of patients) versus usual care over the short term (six months or less), and were pooled in a meta-analysis. Participants in the intervention group had better adherence than those receiving usual care (odds ratio (OR) 1.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 2.88; 7 studies; 11,204 participants; moderate-quality evidence). A separate analysis also showed improvements in long-term adherence rates (more than six months) using intensification of care (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.91 to 4.29; 3 studies; 663 participants; high-quality evidence). Analyses of the effect on total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels also showed a positive effect of intensified interventions over both short- and long-term follow-up. Over the short term, total cholesterol decreased by a mean of 17.15 mg/dL (95% CI 1.17 to 33.14; 4 studies; 430 participants; low-quality evidence) and LDL-cholesterol decreased by a mean of 19.51 mg/dL (95% CI 8.51 to 30.51; 3 studies; 333 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Over the long term (more than six months) total cholesterol decreased by a mean of 17.57 mg/dL (95% CI 14.95 to 20.19; 2 studies; 127 participants; high-quality evidence). Included studies did not report usable data for health outcome indications, adverse effects or costs/resource use, so we could not pool these outcomes. We assessed each included study for bias using methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. In general, the risk of bias assessment revealed a low risk of selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias. There was unclear risk of bias relating to blinding for most studies.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence in our review demonstrates that intensification of patient care interventions improves short- and long-term medication adherence, as well as total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels. Healthcare systems which can implement team-based intensification of patient care interventions may be successful in improving patient adherence rates to lipid-lowering medicines.
