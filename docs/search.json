    "text": "Pharmacist-led comprehensive medication management (CMM): A systematic review of patient outcomes, patient experiences, and provider experiences.”\n\n\nThe role of pharmacists in the United States for patient care has changed in recent years. In California, for example, amendments to the Business and Professions Code have expanded pharmacists’ scope of practice beyond the traditional roles of dispensing drugs and basic counseling.[2] Consequently, pharmacists have become more involved in providing evidence-based practices that better meet the needs of their patient or client populations. Previous systematic reviews have addressed the benefits of pharmacist-led interventions, showing their impact on patients living with chronic diseases such as asthma and diabetes.[4] Moreover, previous systematic reviews have demonstrated the value of such interventions in ensuring unmet healthcare needs. Such studies establish the importance of pharmacist-led interventions to patients. Coupled with reviews that focus on reductions in economic costs to patients and health systems,[7] pharmacist-led interventions are a critical boon to public health infrastructure and performance.\nThe scale-up of pharmacist-led interventions in the United States stems from the collaborative drug therapy management (CDTM) framework, which integrates interprofessional, collaborative practice models to provide affordable, high-quality, and safe patient-centered care.[9] The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 and the Patient Protection and Affordability Act (ACA) of 2010 codified medication therapy management (MTM) as an ideal standard of care within the CDTM framework.8 Wherein pharmacists are more engaged with their patient population and carry out reviews of drug profiles to ensure their safety and efficacy for patients. MTM is a standard of care that aims to ensure that patients in a health system receive the best medication therapy to achieve any pharmacotherapeutic goals.[9]\nOperating in this environment, stakeholders have developed comprehensive medication management (CMM), a process of care that defines the delivery of medication management.[12] CMM as a process is distinct from the MTM standard because it requires an assessment of patients’ medications for appropriateness, effectiveness, and safety. The CMM process calls for the development of patient-centered care plans which capture patients’ clinical status and a care plan they understand and agree to follow. It is a process that stipulates clinically appropriate follow-up evaluations with patients to assess progress toward stated treatment goals. Furthermore, CMM requires formulating a healthcare team to serve patient needs and collaboration between the team’s members. Thus, pharmacists must work with other providers, such as physicians and nurses, to deliver on the three additional components of the CMM process.[12]\nHealth systems encounter challenges regarding misuse, underuse, and overuse of medications, and such challenges continue to drive the uptake of CMM processes. This situation has led to a growing body of research highlighting CMM’s positive effects. Several studies have established CMM’s positive impact on patient outcomes regarding chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. For example, several studies highlight reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, a critical factor in assessing the health of people with diabetes.[15] Behavioral composite scores in health areas such as smoking cessation, meeting HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and blood pressure goals have shown improvements in health systems implementing CMM. Similarly, other studies have focused on establishing CMM contributions to containing long-term costs from the perspective of both patients and payers into the health system.\n\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no current systematic reviews or meta-analyses have broadly encompassed the existing evidence on CMM-based interventions and their impact on patients living with hypertension in the United States. Furthermore, the research recommends a multidimensional evaluation of interventions rather than focusing on therapeutic outcomes, as that will provide a more extensive understanding of the effect on health care. Therefore, this team’s systematic review will investigate the effects of pharmacist-led CMM interventions on health-related outcomes (i.e., therapeutic, safety, and humanistic) and on economic outcomes in the United States. Our review aim is built around the PICO framework (see Figure 1).[16]\n\n\n\nAn illustration of systematic review constructs based on the PICO framework.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis review covers one health condition, high blood pressure or essential hypertension. The patient population receiving CMM services varies in terms of healthcare setting (e.g., ambulatory care, hospital inpatient, or community care) and demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, income level, or age). Furthermore, the population of providers offering CMM services also varies in terms of setting (e.g., community or hospital pharmacy) and provider characteristics (e.g., clinical pharmacists or community pharmacists).\n\n\n\nPharmacist-led direct patient interventions serve as a mechanism to close the gap between base practice and usual care. Medication Therapy Management (MTM) is the language adopted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and incorporated in the 2003 Medicare Part D statutes to offer a baseline standard of care and to contextualize the dynamic relationship between pharmacists and prescribers. MTM aims to ensure patients receive the best medication therapy to achieve their pharmacological goals. CMM emerged from the language of MTM. It is a care process that goes beyond the basics outlined via MTM. CMM ensures that patients receive a comprehensive review of their medication, and the review establishes the medication regimen to be safe, effective, and appropriate. CMM contains four critical components. Firstly, a healthcare team acts collaboratively to provide direct care to patients. Secondly, there is the development of a patient-centered care plan which receives patient approval, agreement, and active participation. The CMM demands assessing patient clinical status for all medications and unique health problems. Finally, the patient is offered a clinically appropriate follow-up to assess progress toward treatment goals (see Figure 2).\n\n\n\nThe novelty of pharmacist-led CMM interventions means there will be some variation in implementation. The standard of care defined by MTM may also confuse how interventions are documented in the literature. For example, MTM, as defined in Medicare Part D, may be implemented without dispensing any medication or product. It does not require an assessment of a patient’s clinical status and a review of all medications. MTM also does not demand the action of a collaborative team in the process. Researchers may also not use the language of CMM when characterizing or documenting an intervention. Similarly, the needs of patient populations, a health system’s infrastructure, and other factors may produce interventions that are a hodge-podge of CMM components. Therefore, this review will contain the added step of certifying described interventions as following the CMM process defined above (see Figure 2).[12]\n\n\n\nAn illustration of the CMM process as denoted by ACCP et al. (2018)\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorically, the role of pharmacists has centered on dispensing services. However, the CDTM framework has expanded pharmacists’ role, making them integral to patient-centered care. Coupled with existing health system challenges such as the misuse, underuse, and overuse of medication, stakeholders, see CMM as critical to providing positive clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes. Previous systematic reviews had covered the issue of pharmacist-led interventions, such as de Barra et al. (2018)[3] and its predecessor Nkansah et al. (2010).[4] Both reviews highlighted the value of such interventions when it came to several chronic conditions affecting the patient health outcomes. Other systematic reviews focused on pharmacist-led interventions and have centered on providing evidence for the positive effects on payers, such as private sector insurers and governments. However, there needs to be more studies cataloging and summarizing CMM specifically. In our search, we came across one CMM-specific narrative review. However, the study team was concerned with developing a framework to conceptualize how CMM implementation can financially benefit health plans and primary care delivery systems.7 To the best of our knowledge, this review will highlight the extent to which CMM is used in caring for patients with hypertension. In addition to the therapeutic, safety and humanistic outcomes experienced by patients, this review will also examine the economic outcomes of CMM use for patients with hypertension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be included in the systematic review, retrieved manuscripts, and reported studies must meet the following criteria:\n\nThe reviewed manuscript must document evidence of CMM intervention. We acknowledge that researchers and health systems deploying interventions in target populations may use terminology different from CMM processes as defined by the ACCP. However, there should be discernible evidence of distinct intervention components that point to a CMM-style intervention.\nManuscripts must have a target population of people living with hypertension or at risk for hypertension or pharmacists providing direct care to populations with hypertension.\nManuscripts must report on patient-related therapeutic, safety, or humanistic outcomes or manuscripts must cover economic outcome measures related to the implementation of CMM.\nManuscripts must be published in English (or a serviceable English translation must be available).\nManuscripts must detail the following types of studies, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies (such as cohort or case studies), and sensitivity studies. We will exclude the following types of citations or manuscripts, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, books, book chapters, bibliographies, dissertations, lectures, conference abstracts, book reviews, news articles, theses, study protocols (without study data), registered clinical trials (without study data), and clinical drug trials.\nManuscript must detail studies conducted in the United States (i.e., all 50 states and territories).\nManuscripts must be published from 2010 onwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will conduct systematic searches in the following electronic health-related databases through December 16, 2022. Databases to be searched include:\n\nThe National Library of Medicine’s (NLM) bibliographic database, MEDLINE. This database indexes journal articles and other published material in the life sciences with a concentration on biomedicine. Using PubMed as the search interface, we will employ board searches of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) (2010 to 2022).\nThe Cochrane Library is a collection of databases focused on several healthcare specialties. Relevant databases include the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Methodology Register (CMR), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA), and NHS Economic Evaluation Database (EED). We will employ the Wiley Online Library interface.\nThe Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) indexes journal articles and manuscripts published in English-language and selected other languages, concentrating on nursing, allied health, biomedicine, and healthcare. We will employ the EBSCO interface.\nEmbase is a biomedical database employing Emtree to create deep biomedical indexing or published research. We will use Ovid as the search interface.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the primary databases listed above, we will hand search the reference lists of the systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and review articles to identify references that our electronic database search missed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy selection will begin with eliminating duplicate references found in the various databases. The review team will use Zotero to curate and catalog extracted references to form our analytic corpus.[17]. Zotero, offers a powerful de-duplication feature, allowing the team to identify and consolidate duplicates from across multiple databases. After consolidating duplicates, the remaining references will be moved on to the initial step of title and abstract screening.\n\n\n\nThe team will rely on the Sysrev Platform, to conduct the Title/Abstract screening, Full-text screening and Data extraction steps of this systematic review.[20] Sysrev accessed via their website (https://www.sysrev.com), is a web-based tool that combines systematic evidence review (SER) methods with other data workflows, including generalized data curation, education, and workflows involving collaboration between humans and between humans and machines for evaluation of digital documents or corpuses. Sysrev provides a mechanism for conducting all the required systematic mapping objectives of this protocol, including title and abstract screening, full-text screening and data extraction and preliminary analysis. The platform incorporates some machine learning and natural language processing algorithms to sort articles according to inputted inclusion or exclusion criteria. The Sysrev Platform also helps to reduce the effects of selection bias during evaluation of materials for inclusion. The members of the coding team are assigned citations/ references to review at random, while using the Platform. Members of the coding team are also blinded from labels and coding results produced by their colleagues during the process. Finally, there is evidence of the Sysrev Platform’s robustness as a tool for data extraction given it has been used in peer-reviewed publications to screen manuscripts, facilitate study selection and extract relevant data.[22]\n\n\n\nOnce the corpus of citations and references is complete (i.e., extracted from select databases), we will begin screening for inclusion using the Sysrev Platform. The process begins with training the screening and data extraction team. The team consists of six individuals. After detailed review of the study protocol and using subsample of citations taken at random from the corpus (i.e., at least 10% or the corpus), the team members will code the articles for inclusion. The Sysrev Platform, will assign citations/references to the project team, at random ensuring that each citation/reference is independently coded twice. The Sysrev Platform also provides an assessment of concordance between the reviewers based on coding patterns. The degree of agreement between reviewers provided as a percentage, will The training will also serve as means to get the team members familiar with the Sysrev Platform.\n\n\n\nOnce training is complete, we will then move to screening of the corpus using the criteria for including references (see Section 2.1 above). Using random sampling, the corpus will be divided into three chunks with each pair of coders tackling one chunk. Withing Sysrev, our chosen platform, there will have to be agreement between a coding pair to move a citation to the next stage of the process (i.e., Full-text screening). We will resolve conflicts based on discussion, with the final decision and approval left up to the project leads (i.e., SAB and NB). On completion, coding results will be exported as a spreadsheet, for review.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a narrower corpus produced from initial screening, the team will review full-text manuscripts using the criteria for inclusion defined above (Section 2.1). Again using a random sample approach, this new corpus will be divided into three chunks with each pair of coders tackling one chunk, via Sysrev. As with title and abstract screening, there will have to be agreement between a coding pair to move the citation (and manuscript) to the next stage of the process (i.e., Data extraction). As with the previous stage, we willr eovle conflicts based on discussion between coders, with final decision and approval left up to the project leads. Manuscripts approved for data-extraction are then moved to the next stage in the systematic review.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will index included studies according to the health-related (i.e., therapeutic, safety, humanistic) and economic outcome areas. The review team will then extract data from the included studies. We will use an extraction form developed a priori and based on the generalized data extraction form developed by The Cochrane Collaboration and published in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.[24] The form was developed and reviewed by a project lead (i.e., SAB) and is minimize variability. As with title/abstract and full-text screening, the team will use the Sysrev Platform. Data extraction will include the following categories:\n\nStudy Characteristics (e.g., study design, setting, disease state, the hierarchy of outcomes) Intervention Characteristics (e.g., CMM components/constructs).\nPatient characteristics (e.g., age, gender, type of health insurance).\nPharmacist (or health provider team) characteristics (e.g., community pharmacist, ambulatory pharmacist, provider qualifications).\nStudy outcomes (i.e., the therapeutic, safety, humanistic and economic outcomes resulting from CMM implementation are ranked from favorable to not favorable).\n\n\n\nWe anticipate that studies will report health-related and economic outcomes. To summarize results systematically, the data extraction team will use the following categories (based on the approach adopted by Chilsom-Burn and colleagues):\n\nFavorable – Study outcomes with a p-value less than 0.05, indicating statistically significant positive changes due to the implementation of CMM.\nNot Favorable – Study outcomes with a p-value less than 0.05, indicating statistically significant negative changes due to the implementation of CMM.\nMixed – Study outcomes are positive for one or more of the reported study outcomes but negative for one or more of the other reported study outcomes.\nNo effect – Study outcomes demonstrate no statistically significant changes in either direction (indicated by a p-value of 0.05).\nUnclear – The nature of the study outcomes is unclear, given the data and information provided in the manuscript.\n\nWith the novelty of CMM interventions and the lack of a systematic summary of existing studies, we propose creating a hierarchy of outcomes based on the hierarchy developed by the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ).\n\nLevel 1 – Clinical, quality of life outcomes (e.g., morbidity, mortality, adverse events, deaths prevented, intervention net benefits).\nLevel 2 – Surrogate outcomes or intermediate outcomes (e.g., laboratory results, blood pressure measurements).\nLevel 3 – Other measurable variables (e.g., knowledge of medication, disease status, or intervention).\nLevel 4 – Other relevant variables (e.g., patient satisfaction, provider experiences).\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing data extraction, we will use Stata statistical software, version 14, to report summary statistics for all the studies we include in our systematic review. We will group studies by outcome area (i.e., therapeutic, safety, humanistic, and economic outcomes). Where appropriate, we will present summary statistics. Where the selected studies report results in multiple outcome areas, we will include the study data in the analysis of each relevant area. For instance, if a study reports blood pressure measures and adverse events prevented per dollar spent on CMM intervention, the study will be reported in both the therapeutic and economic analyses portions of this systematic review. Finally, we will calculate Pearson’s coefficient to evaluate the interrater reliability of the reviewer and data extraction teams."

To begin using SysRev, you will need to create an account (if you have already created one, please skip to step 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the Sign up for SysRev button (alternatively copy and paste the above link into your browser).\nUse a preferred email address and password (There is an option to sign up with a Google.com (i.e., Gmail) account if that works better for you in terms of keeping track of username and password information).\nOnce you sign-up you will have to verify your email address to ensure that your account is activated (SysRev is free to use, so no worries about making any payments).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are able to start your own projects within the Platform. However, to get started with this project, I have to invite you to projects that I have created. Take the following steps to ensure you are invited to the correct projects so we may proceed.\n\nOnce you complete your sign-up, inform me and I can invite you to the projects. That process won’t take long. You will get an email from me (Email: sbutame@ph.lacounty.gov) with a link to a SysRev project.\nThat project will be titled — Training-Stage1-TitlesAbstract (Or something similar). This guide contains images that are meant to serve as a guide to what you will interract with as you use the SysRev Platorm. There may be some variation in the names of the spefic projects that you encounter, and as we move forward with screening and eventually data extraction.\nWhen you receive the email from me, sign-in to your SysRev account, and then click on the link (within the email). If you have any trouble with this portion, please let me know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve accepted the project invitation, you will see all the projects you have accepted listed to the left of the landing page, under Your Projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo begin, select the relevant project. On clicking the specific project, you will have access to a similar project menu shown below. This menu gives you access to five items:\n\nOverview Page – A project summary, summary statistics and summary information on the project.\nArticles Page – A listing of the data (or articles/citations) that have been uploaded to the project.\nData Page – A summary page on the project data.\nUsers Page – Information about project collaborators and colleagues.\nAnalytics Page – Indepth statistics on the project and progress of collaborators (only accessible by the administrator).\nReview Page – Information on what remains to be done for the project (A blank page means nothing left to do).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Overview page gives a short explanation of the project, research question and the criteria we are using for screening or extracting data.\n\n\n\nSysRev - Project Overview page Part I\n\n\nThis page also displays a series of boxes, to provide summary on the data you and your collaborators will extract from citations/references.\n\nThe Review Status box will show how far along you have come in terms of citations or articles reviewed, whether you chose to include or exclude them etc.\nThe Project Document box contains PDF copies of the study protocol and a separate list of the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. Review these to help with your work.\nThe Prediction Histogram box will present information on your progress. As I mentioned earlier, the SysRev Platform employs machine learning and natural language processing in the background as you work attempting to predict your coding patterns and that of the project team.\nFinally, the Important Terms box, also employs the machine learning functions to provide some summary information on the citations and references we are screening.\n\nOnce you begin screening citations, this page may look someting similar to the below, populated with data interpreted by the platform.\n\n\n\nSysRev Project Overview page Part II (Featured project Wb literature review - Stage 3 Data extraction\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Articles page provides a list of the citations/references uploaded into the project. There are several ways to load the citation corpus into SysRev. At present you don’t need to worry about this process. When you are ready to begin screeing, you will find all the necessary data listed in this section.\n\n\n\nSysRev Project Articles page\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Data page will provide a summary of those citations/references and the changes you and your fellow reviewers have made to each in terms of coding (I will explain further). As you can see from the image below it is similar to the Articles Page but is optimized for manipulating labels and exporting data. Only the project administrators have access to the data here.\n\n\n\nSysRev Data page\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Analytics page is closed off to you. Just note that it provides based on your coding and screen activity (It is not pertinent to our screening activity). As with the data page, only the project administrators have access to the data here.\n\n\n\nSysRev Analytics page\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you are working through screening or reviewing the citations in the corpus, the Review page will indicate how many citations (manuscripts) are left to you.\n\n\n\nIf you want some additional information on the SysRev Platform for your own work, Insillica LLC, owners of SysRev provide some instructional videos."

    "text": "Getting Started\nWe have already had an introduction to SysRev, so it is time to dive on in.\n\nLog-in to your account\nYou will see projects listed in your profile by name (if I have invited you to a project).\nClick on the project (e.g., Stage1-TitlesAbstracts) to access the landing page described above.\nTo begin, click on Review Page tab.\n\nThe Platform will feed you the next unscreened citation/reference in the list. The landing window will be as follows:\n\nOn the left, you will see a listing of labels.\nOn the right you will see the citations including: Title, Journal, Publication year, Authors, and Abstract (if available).\n\n\n\n\nGetting started with a review\n\n\nTo begin, read and review citation/reference information on the right and then move to the Labels panel on the left. There are two questions in the Labels panel and you will have to provide responses to both. The first section is Include. Here you have to decide whether to\n\nInclude\n\nor\n\nExcluded\n\nNote that this is a REQUIRED question.\nIf you decide to Include (i.e., YES), move to the Exclude tab. And from the drop down menu select a Not Applicable (i.e., the first item in the dropdown menu).\nIf you decide to Exclude (i.e., NO), move to the Exclude tab. And from the drop down menu select your reason (or reasons for exclusion). Note that you are able to provide multiple reasons for exclusion, so select all that apply.\nProviding a response in the Exclude tab is REQUIRED.\nOnce these two steps are complete, you click on Save.\nAnd just like that you are done with screening a citation/reference. The SysRev Platform will immediately deliver the next citation/reference in the system to be screened. Repeat the steps outlined above, deciding whether to Include or Exclude the citation.\nWhen you first come across a citation/reference in Sysrev, you have the option to Skip.\nWhen screening, at times you may be unsure and desire to to maul over the material before you make a decision. The Skip option gives you that breathing room.\nThe Skip, will place the citation/reference you are looking at the back of your list, and present you with the next on your list. You will eventually have to screen that citation/ reference.\n\nScreening Checks\nThere are features within SysRev to ensure that you follow the steps outlined above. If you decide to include a citation/reference (i.e., you select YES), your choice will produce a green plus sign in the upper left corner of the Include tab.\nIf you decide to Exclude a citation/reference (i.e., you select NO), your choice will produce an orange munus sign in the upper left corner of the Include tab.\nSimilarly, when you select Not Applicable in the Exclude tab, a green plus appears in the upper left of that tab. And when you select a reason explaining why chose to Exclude, a small orange minus sign appears in the same spot.\nConsequently, if you are going to Include a citation you should see two green plus signs.\n\n\n\nA decision to Include should show two green plus signs\n\n\nHowever, if your responses are mismatched, the entire section will take on a reddish color, to alert you to a problem.\n\n\n\nA reddish color indicates you have entered incorrect values.\n\n\n\n\n\nA decision to Exclude should show two minus signs and the tabs should be highlighted a dull red\n\n\nAs you screen, you want one of the two scenarios shown below. Either there should be two green plus signs, indicating a decision to Include, or two orange minus signs, indicating a decision to Exclude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclucde\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and Notes\nAs you are screening Titles/Abstracts, if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me (Email: sbutame@ph.lacounty.gov). Alternatively you may note any questions you have in the SysRev Platform. Under each citation/ reference in the Review page there is a space to enter notes.\n\n\n\nAn option to ask questions or give notes\n\n\n\n\nOne Last Note\nIf after reviewing the title and abstract of a citation, and you remain uncertain, default to Including the citation. The second pass at screening (i.e., Full-Text Screening) will help to resolve uncertainties given you will have access to critical context from the full-text."
