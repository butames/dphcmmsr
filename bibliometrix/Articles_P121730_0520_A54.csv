We compared a physician‐pharmacist collaborative model (PPCM) to usual care in patients with TRH participating in the Collaboration Among Pharmacists and Physicians To Improve Outcomes Now study. At baseline, 169 patients (27% of Collaboration Among Pharmacists and Physicians To Improve Outcomes Now patients) had TRH: 111 received the PPCM intervention and 58 received usual care. Baseline characteristics were similar between treatment arms. After 9 months, adjusted mean systolic blood pressure was reduced by 7 mm Hg more with PPCM intervention than usual care (P = .036). Blood pressure control was 34.2% with PPCM versus 25.9% with usual care (adjusted odds ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.33‐11.2). These findings suggest that team‐based care in the primary care setting may be effective for TRH. Additional research is needed regarding the long‐term impact of these models and to identify patients most likely to benefit from team‐based interventions.",

The primary objective of this study was to examine blood pressure (BP) control in hypertensive patients managed by a newly formed PharmD-PCP MTM team versus usual care in a university-based primary care clinic. Methods: This randomized, pragmatic clinical trial was conducted in hypertensive patients randomly selected for PharmD-PCP MTM or usual care. In the PharmD-PCP MTM group, pharmacists managed drug-therapy initiation and monitoring, medication adjustments, biometric assessments, laboratory tests, and patient education. In the usual-care group, patients continued to see their PCPs. Participants were aged >/=18 years, were diagnosed with hypertension, had a most recent BP measurement of >/=140/ >/=90 mm Hg (>/=130/ >/=80 mm Hg if codiagnosed with diabetes mellitus), were on at least 1 antihypertensive medication, and were English speaking. The primary outcome was the difference in the mean change from baseline in systolic BP at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included the percentage achieving therapeutic BP goal and the mean changes from baseline in diastolic BP and lowand high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Findings: A total of 166 patients were enrolled (69 men; mean age, 67.7 years; PharmD-PCP MTM group, n = 75; usual-care group, n = 91). Mean reduction in SBP was significantly greater in the PharmD-PCP MTM group at 6 months (-7.1 [19.4] vs +1.6 [21.0] mm Hg; P = 0.008), but the difference was no longer statistically significant at 9 months (-5.2 [16.9] vs -1.7 [17.7] mm Hg; P = 0.22), based on an intent-to-treat analysis. In the intervention group, greater percentages of patients who continued to see the MTM pharmacist versus those who returned to their PCP were at goal at 6 months (81% vs 44%) and at 9 months (70% vs 52%). No significant betweengroup differences in changes in cholesterol were detected at 6 and 9 months; however, the mean baseline values were near recommended levels. The PharmD-PCP MTM group had significantly fewer PCP visits compared with the usual-care group (1.8 [1.5] vs 4.2 [1.0]; P o 0.001). Implications: A PharmD-PCP collaborative MTM service was more effective in lowering BP than was usual care at 6 months in all patients and at 9 months in patients who continued to see the pharmacist. Incorporating pharmacists into the primary care team may be a successful strategy for managing medication therapy, improving patient outcomes and possibly extending the capacity of primary care.",

M.; Boonyasai, Romsai T.; Albert, Michael; Marsteller, Jill A.; Cooper, Lisa A.","OBJECTIVE: We studied whether care management is a pragmatic solution for improving population blood pressure (BP) control and addressing BP disparities  between Blacks and Whites in routine clinical environments. DESIGN:  Quasi-experimental, observational study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 3,964  uncontrolled hypertensive patients receiving primary care within the last year  from one of six Baltimore clinics were identified as eligible. INTERVENTION:  Three in-person sessions over three months with registered dietitians and  pharmacists who addressed medication titration, patient adherence to healthy  behaviors and medication, and disparities-related barriers. MAIN MEASURES: We  assessed the population impact of care management using the RE-AIM framework. To  evaluate effectiveness in improving BP, we used unadjusted, adjusted, and  propensity-score matched differences-in-differences models to compare those who  completed all sessions with partial completers and non-participants. RESULTS: Of  all eligible patients, 5% participated in care management. Of 629 patients who  entered care management, 245 (39%) completed all three sessions. Those completing  all sessions on average reached BP control (mean BP 137/78) and experienced 9 mm  Hg systolic blood pressure (P<.001) and 4 mm Hg DBP (P=.004) greater improvement  than non-participants; findings did not vary in adjusted or propensity-score  matched models. Disparities in systolic and diastolic BP between Blacks and  Whites were not detectable at completion. CONCLUSIONS: It may be possible to  achieve BP control among both Black and White patients who participate in a few  sessions of care management. However, the very limited reach and patient  challenges with program completion should raise significant caution with relying  on care management alone to improve population BP control and eliminate related  disparities.",

Michael","BACKGROUND: Adherence to cardioprotective medications in the year after acute coronary syndrome hospitalization is generally poor and is associated with  increased risk of rehospitalization and mortality. Few interventions have  specifically targeted this high-risk patient population to improve medication  adherence. We hypothesize that a multifaceted patient-centered intervention could  improve adherence to cardioprotective medications. METHODS AND RESULTS: To  evaluate this intervention, we propose enrolling 280 patients with a recent acute  coronary syndrome event into a multicenter randomized, controlled trial. The  intervention comprises 4 main components: (1) pharmacist-led medication  reconciliation and tailoring; (2) patient education; (3) collaborative care  between pharmacist and primary care provider/cardiologist; and (4) 2 types of  voice messaging (educational and medication refill reminder calls). Patients in  the intervention arm will visit with the study pharmacist ≈1 week post-hospital  discharge. The pharmacist will work with the patient and collaborate with  providers to reconcile medication issues. Voice messages will augment the  educational process and remind patients to refill their cardioprotective  medications. The study will compare the intervention versus usual care for 12  months. The primary outcome of interest is adherence using the ReComp method.  Secondary and tertiary outcomes include achievement of targets for blood pressure  and low-density lipoprotein, and reduction in the combined cardiovascular end  points of myocardial infarction hospitalization, coronary revascularization, and  all-cause mortality. Finally, we will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the  intervention compared with usual care. CONCLUSIONS: If the intervention is  effective in improving medication adherence and demonstrating a lower cost, the  intervention has the potential to improve cardiovascular outcomes in this  high-risk patient population.",

Outcomes Res.,"Maeng, D.D.; Graham, J.; Bogart, M.; Hao, J.; Wright, E.A.","Purpose: Pharmacist-led medication therapy disease management (MTDM) has shown improvement in clinical outcomes in patients with certain chronic diseases. However, only limited data demonstrating the impact on health care utilization and cost of care are available. This study seeks to evaluate the impact of a pharmacist-led MTDM program on clinical surrogate outcomes, care utilization, and cost of care among patients with diabetes mellitus. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted by utilizing electronic health records and insurance claims data. Patients were identified between February 2011 and December 2014. Data were collected from Geisinger, a large integrated health care system located in Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey. A total of 5,500 patients with diabetes mellitus were identified; 2,750 were enrolled in MTDM and were 1-to-1 propensity score-matched to a comparison cohort not enrolled in a pharmacist-led MTDM program. Results: There were no differences between groups in composite HbA1c, blood pressure, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal attainment at 12 months (12% vs 12%, P=0.53). HbA1c goal was reached more frequently among patients without MTDM compared to those at 12 months (57% vs 51%, P<0.0001). There were no significant differences between the two cohorts in the attainment of blood pressure or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals at 12 months. MTDM was associated with reduced all-cause hospitalization rate (–19.6%; P=0.02) as well as increased primary care physician visits (18.5%; P<0.001) and lower average per-member-per-month medical cost (–13%, P=0.027). Conclusion: Despite the lack of impact on the clinical surrogate outcomes, MTDM was associated with lower cost of care and fewer hospitalizations, possibly facilitated by increased monitoring (ie, higher primary care utilization).",

SETTING: The Patients, Pharmacists Partnerships  (P(3) Program) was offered as an ""opt-in"" benefit to employees of 6 public and  private self-insured employers in Maryland and Virginia. Care was provided in ZIP  code-matched locations and at 2 employers' worksites. PRACTICE DESCRIPTION: Six  hundred two enrolled patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes were studied between  July 2006 and May 2012 with an average follow-up of 2.5 years per patient. Of  these patients, 162 had health plan cost and utilization data. A network of 50  trained pharmacists provided chronic disease management to patients with diabetes  using a common process of care. Communications were provided to patients and  physicians. PRACTICE INNOVATION: Employers provided incentives for patients who  opted in, including waived medication copayments and free diabetes  self-monitoring supplies. The service was provided at no cost to the patient. A  Web-based, electronic medical record that complied with the Health Insurance  Portability and Accountability Act helped to standardize care. Quality assurance  was conducted to ensure the standard of care. EVALUATION: Glycosylated hemoglobin  (A1c), blood pressure, and total health care costs (before and after enrollment).  RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were shown by mean decreases in  A1c (-0.41%, P <0.001), low-density lipoprotein levels (-4.7 mg/dL, P = 0.003),  systolic blood pressure (-2.3 mm Hg, P = 0.001), and diastolic blood pressure  (-2.4 mm Hg, P <0.001). Total annual health care costs to employers declined by  $1031 per beneficiary after the cost of the program was deducted. This 66-month  real-world study confirms earlier findings. Employers netted savings through  improved clinical outcomes and reduced emergency and hospital utilization when  comparing costs 12 months before and after enrollment. CONCLUSION: The P(3)  program had positive clinical outcomes and economic outcomes. Pharmacist-provided  comprehensive medication therapy management services should be included as a  required element of insurance offered by employers and health insurance  exchanges.",

We examined whether the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention, a pharmacist‐led intervention combining elements found in efficacy studies to lower BP, improved BP among patients with diabetes mellitus with persistent hypertension and poor refill adherence or insufficient medication intensification in 2 high‐performing health systems. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a prospective, multisite cluster randomized pragmatic trial with randomization of 16 primary care teams at 5 medical centers (3 Veterans Affairs and 2 Kaiser Permanente) to the Adherence and Intensification of Medications intervention or usual care. The primary outcome was relative change in systolic BP (SBP), comparing 1797 intervention with 2303 control team patients, from 6 months preceding to 6 months after the 14‐month intervention period. We examined shorter‐term changes in SBP as a secondary outcome. The mean SBP decrease from 6 months before to 6 months after the intervention period was ≈9 mm Hg in both arms. Mean SBPs of eligible intervention patients were 2.4 mm Hg lower (95% CI: ‐3.4 to ‐1.5; P<0.001) immediately after the intervention than those achieved by control patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Adherence and Intensification of Medications program more rapidly lowered SBPs among intervention patients, but usual‐care patients achieved equally low SBP levels by 6 months after the intervention period. These findings show the importance of evaluating in different real‐life clinical settings programs found in efficacy trials to be effective before urging their widespread adoption in all settings.

Methods: A Markov model cohort simulation with a 6‐month cycle length to predict acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and heart failure throughout lifetime was performed. A cohort of 399 patients was obtained from two prospective, cluster randomized controlled clinical trials implementing physician‐pharmacist collaborative interventions in community‐based medical offices in the Midwest, USA. Framingham risk equations and other algorithms were used to predict the vascular diseases. SBP reduction due to the interventions deteriorated until 5 years. Direct medical costs using a payer perspective were adjusted to 2015 dollar value, and the main outcome was quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs); both were discounted at 3%. The intervention costs were estimated from the trials, whereas the remaining parameters were from published studies. A series of sensitivity analyses including changing patient risks of vascular diseases, probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and a cost‐effectiveness acceptability curve were performed. Results: The lifetime incremental costs were $26 807.83 per QALY (QALYs gained = 0.14). The intervention provided the greatest benefit for the high‐risk patients, moderate benefit for the trial patients, and the lowest benefit for the low‐risk patients. If a payer is willing to pay $50 000 per QALY gained, in 48.6% of the time the intervention would be cost‐effective. Conclusion: Team‐based care such as a physician‐pharmacist collaboration appears to be a cost‐effective strategy for treating hypertension. The intervention is most cost‐effective for high‐risk patients.",

SUMMARY: A telehealth program including  CPS services was developed to improve healthcare access and quality for veterans  in rural areas of the Pacific Northwest. Outcomes of medication management  services provided by a CPS team during both clinical video telehealth and  telephone encounters with 554 patients from October 2014 to March 2017 were  assessed. Patients were targeted for diabetes (DM), hyperlipidemia (HLD), and  hypertension (HTN) control and tobacco cessation; the respective primary outcomes  were the mean changes from baseline in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) and  blood pressure values and rates of guideline-indicated statin therapy and tobacco  cessation. Patients in the DM and HTN groups had a mean absolute HbA(1c)  reduction of 1.61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39-1.83%; p < 0.0001) and a  mean systolic blood pressure reduction of 26.00 mm Hg (95% CI, 22.99-28.50 mm Hg;  p < 0.001), respectively. In the HLD group, 93% of patients were discharged on a  lipid-lowering medication. Tobacco cessation was achieved in 42% of targeted  patients. CONCLUSION: CPSs providing primary care comprehensive medication  management services solely via telehealth improved disease management and access  to healthcare in a population of rural veterans. Statistically significant  improvements in DM and HTN outcomes were demonstrated along with clinically  significant improvements in the areas of lipid management and tobacco cessation.",

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate blood pressure (BP) control 18 months following the discontinuation of a physician‐pharmacist collaborative intervention. This was a retrospective analysis of patients who had previously participated in a prospective, cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial. Six community‐based family medicine offices were randomized to control or intervention groups. Research nurses measured BPs using an automated device during the prospective trial. The research nurses then abstracted data from medical records, including BPs, medications, changes in therapy, and laboratory values for 18 months following the discontinuation of the 6‐month prospective trial. The study included 228 patients in the control (n = 146) or intervention (n = 82) groups. The control group contained more patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease (P < .013), were older (P = .047), and had more coexisting conditions (P < .001) than the intervention group. Systolic BP 9 months following discontinuation of the physician‐pharmacist intervention was 137.2 ± 18.2 mm Hg and 129.8 ± 13.3 mm Hg in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = .0015). BP control was maintained in 61 (41.8%) control patients and 55 (67.1%) intervention patients (P = .0003). At 18 months post‐intervention, systolic BP was 138.1 ± 20.4 mm Hg and 130.0 ± 16.0 mm Hg in the control and intervention groups, respectively (P = .023). BP control was maintained in 53 (36.3%) control patients and 55 (67.1%) intervention patients at 18 months post‐intervention (P < .0001). A sensitivity analysis was conducted to address the uneven distribution of patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, and the differences between groups were still significant. BP control rates remained significantly higher following a physician‐pharmacist intervention compared with usual care for 18 months after discontinuation of the intervention. This model has the potential value as a useful long‐term strategy to benefit patients with hypertension.",

Nicole; Chaki, Amber; Sando, Karen R.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate a diabetes education program that includes a pharmacist as a member of the diabetes management team by  assessing the change in hemoglobin A1c (A1C), cholesterol, and blood pressure for  patients with type 2 diabetes in outpatient clinics. METHODS: This was a  retrospective study in outpatient clinics at Shands Jacksonville Medical Center.  The patients were assigned into either the pharmacist group or the nonpharmacist  group, according to the presence or the absence of a pharmacist in the clinic.  The primary end point was the absolute change in A1C versus baseline. Secondary  end points included change in cholesterol and blood pressure and the number of  patients to attain American Diabetes Association goals. End points were recorded  to correlate within 3 months of the initial visit and final visit with a  provider. RESULTS: Compared to the nonpharmacist group, patients in the  pharmacist group had more advanced and uncontrolled diabetes at baseline. The  pharmacist group showed a greater percent change in A1C and improvement between  the initial and final clinic visits, after adjusting for baseline confounders.  Despite the statistically significant improvement in A1C in the pharmacist group,  there was no difference found between the 2 groups for the end points of  cholesterol and blood pressure.

RESEARCH DESIGN: In 2017, we evaluated a  pharmacist-involved team-based care intervention among 3 targeted groups using a  microsimulation model designed to estimate cardiovascular event incidence and  associated health care spending in a cross-section of individuals representative  of the US population: implementing it among patients with: (1) newly diagnosed  hypertension; (2) persistently (≥1 year) uncontrolled blood pressure (BP); or (3)  treated, yet persistently uncontrolled BP-and report outcomes over 5 and 20  years. We describe the spending thresholds for each intervention strategy to  achieve budget neutrality in 5 years from a payer's perspective. RESULTS:  Offering this intervention could prevent 22.9-36.8 million person-years of  uncontrolled BP and 77,200-230,900 heart attacks and strokes in 5 years  (83.8-174.8 million and 393,200-922,900 in 20 years, respectively). Health and  economic benefits strongly favored groups 2 and 3. Assuming an intervention cost  of $525 per enrollee, the intervention generates 5-year budgetary cost-savings  only for Medicare among groups 2 and 3. To achieve budget neutrality in 5 years  across all groups, intervention costs per person need to be around $35 for  Medicaid, $180 for private insurance, and $335 for Medicare enrollees.  CONCLUSIONS: Adopting a pharmacist-involved team-based hypertension model could  substantially improve BP control and cardiovascular outcomes in the United  States. Net cost-savings among groups 2 and 3 make a compelling case for  Medicare, but favorable economics may also be possible for private insurers,  particularly if innovations could moderately lower the cost of delivering an  effective intervention.",

Am. Pharm. Assoc.,"Kristeller, J.; Manning, D.","Objective: The objective is to quantify and describe outcomes achieved through an innovative clinical pharmacy service that initiates collaboration between hospital and community pharmacists and physicians to improve medication use through care transitions. Comprehensive medication reviews (CMRs) are completed during hospitalization and medication-related problems (MRPs) are identified and then addressed with physicians as needed. Acute and chronic care issues are communicated with hospital and community physicians respectively. A summary of the CMR and suggested follow-up interventions or opportunities for patient education is shared with the patient's community pharmacist to facilitate ongoing medication management. The goal of this service is to improve patient outcomes by promoting safe and effective medication use. Methods: This observational study evaluated outcomes achieved during a 20-day timeframe. Eligible patients were admitted to the hospital, had multiple chronic diseases, at least five chronic medications, and a planned discharge to home. Once a CMR was completed, the hospital pharmacist communicated with the patient's hospital or community physician and community pharmacist to resolve or prevent MRPs. Data was gathered on the number of CMRs completed and the number and type of MRPs identified. Additionally, the clinical significance of each pharmacist intervention was scored on two innovative scales-criticality as related to clinical evidence and medication safety, and relevance as related to priorities of the patient. An example of high criticality would be recommending therapy such as an ACE-inhibitor in a patient with diabetes and hypertension where evidence of improved outcomes is widely accepted, or intervening to prevent a major adverse drug reaction. An intervention that is highly relevant to the patient could include issues related to cost, convenience, or improving a patient-oriented outcome such as mortality. Results: Twenty-four CMRs were completed and all but one had at least one MRP. There was an average of 1.6 corrections to the admission medication reconciliation per patient, 4.5 suggestions for the community pharmacist per patient, and 2.2 suggestions for the primary care physician per patient. Cardiovascular drugs were the most frequent class involved in a MRP (37%) followed by endocrine (18%), antithrombotic (13%) and gastrointestinal (11%) drug classes. Eleven percent of pharmacist interventions were scored as having high criticality related to clinical evidence, and 18% had both high criticality and high relevance to the patient. An example of an intervention with high criticality and relevance was identifying and resolving a MRP where a patient admitted with shortness of breath due to atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular ratewas using albuterol five times daily despite no history of pulmonary disease. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the productivity of an innovative pharmacy service focused on improving medication use and safety during care transitions. The service generated data demonstrating the need for pharmacists to complete a CMR and collaborate with hospital and community healthcare providers to resolve or prevent MRPs during error prone transitions of care. Measuring criticality related to clinical evidence and relevance to the patient is a unique strategy to describe the value of this service that has the potential to add an important dimension of information that can be used to solicit stakeholder support for clinical pharmacy services.",

The intervention resulted in improved BP control compared with usual care at both 6 (72% vs. 45%; P < 0.001) and 12 months (71% vs. 53%; P = 0.005). We sought to investigate factors contributing to intervention success. Design: Mixed‐methods analysis of process of care data, patient focus groups, and pharmacist interviews. Participants: Data from 228 intervention patients were examined from the original 450 patients randomly assigned from 16 primary care clinics. Five patient focus groups and 4 pharmacist interviews were conducted to ascertain the patient and pharmacist perspective. Focus group and interview data were coded, and themes relevant to pharmacists were identified. Outcome measures: Home BP readings of less than 135/85 mm Hg and patient focus group and pharmacist interview themes. Results: Mean BP at the intake visit was 148/85 mm Hg. Antihypertensive medications were adjusted in 10% of patients at the initial in‐person visit, 33% at phone visit 1, 36% at phone visit 2, and 19% at phone visit 3. Thereafter, medication changes declined. The mean home BP for patients at the first phone visit was 136/80 mm Hg, 126/74 mm Hg at 3 months, and 123/73 mm Hg at 5 months, with little change thereafter. Key components of success from patient and pharmacist interviews included a strong patient–pharmacist relationship, individualized treatment plans, and frequent phone contact with the pharmacist. Conclusion: Frequent adjustments to the antihypertensive treatment regimen based on home BP telemonitoring resulted in rapid lowering of BP. Our results suggest that an intensive telephone‐based intervention with the key components of medication adjustments, a strong patient and pharmacist relationship, and individualized treatment plans can achieve BP control in only 3 months in many patients with uncontrolled hypertension.",

METHODS: A randomized,  controlled trial of VA MEDIC-E (n = 50) versus standard primary care (n = 49) in  veterans with type 2 diabetes, hemoglobin A1c (A1C) > 7%, blood pressure (BP) >  130/80 mmHg, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > 100mg/dl (2.59  mmol/l) in the previous 6 months was conducted. The VA MEDIC-E intervention  consisted of 4 weekly group sessions followed by 5 monthly booster group  sessions. Each 2-hour session included 1 hour of multidisciplinary diabetes  specific healthy lifestyle education and 1 hour of pharmacotherapeutic  interventions performed by a clinical pharmacist. Evaluation measures included  lab values of A1C, LDL cholesterol, BP, and goal attainment of these values, and  diabetes self-care behavior questionnaires at 6 months. RESULTS: The  randomization groups were similar at baseline in all cardiovascular risk factors  except for LDL, which was significantly lower in the MEDIC-E arm. At 6 months,  significant improvements from baseline were found in the intervention arm for  exercise, foot care, and goal attainment of A1C, LDL-C, and BP but not in the  control arm. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the  pharmacist-led group intervention program for 6 months was an efficacious and  sustainable collaborative care approach to managing diabetes and reducing  associated cardiovascular risk.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: We adapted Kaiser Permanente's evidence-based treatment  protocols in a racially and ethnically diverse population at 12 safety-net  clinics in the San Francisco Health Network. The intervention consisted of 4  elements: a hypertension registry, a simplified treatment intensification  protocol that included fixed-dose combination medications containing diuretics,  standardized BP measurement protocol, and BP check visits led by registered nurse  and pharmacist staff. The study population comprised patients with hypertension  who made ≥1 primary care visits within the past 24 months (n=15 917) and had a  recorded BP measurement within the past 12 months. We conducted a  postintervention time series analysis from August 2014 to August 2016 to assess  the effect of the intervention on BP control for 24 months for the pilot site and  for 15 months for 11 other San Francisco Health Network clinics combined.  Secondary outcomes were changes in use of guideline-recommended medication  prescribing. Rates of BP control increased at the pilot site (68%-74%; P<0.01)  and the 11 other San Francisco Health Network clinic sites (69%-74%; P<0.01).  Statistically significant improvements in BP control rates (P<0.01) at the 11 San  Francisco Health Network clinic sites occurred in all racial and ethnic groups  (blacks, 60%-66%; whites, 69%-75%; Latinos, 67%-72%; Asians, 78%-82%). Use of  fixed-dose combination medications increased from 10% to 13% (P<0.01), and the  percentage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor prescriptions dispensed in  combination with a thiazide diuretic increased from 36% to 40% (P<0.01).  CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based system approaches to improving BP control can be  implemented in safety-net settings and could play a pivotal role in achieving  improved population BP control and reducing hypertension disparities.",

Cindy; Handler, Joel; Brettler, Jeffrey; Rader, Florian; Elashoff, Robert M.","BACKGROUND: We developed a new model of hypertension care for non-Hispanic black men that links health promotion by barbers to medication management by American  Society of Hypertension-certified pharmacists and demonstrated efficacy in a  6-month cluster-randomized trial. The marked reduction in systolic blood pressure  (BP) seen at 6 months warranted continuing the trial through 12 months to test  sustainability, a necessary precondition for implementation research. METHODS: We  enrolled a cohort of 319 black male patrons with systolic BP ≥140 mm Hg at  baseline. Fifty-two Los Angeles County barbershops were assigned to either a  pharmacist-led intervention or an active control group. In the intervention  group, barbers promoted follow-up with pharmacists who prescribed BP medication  under a collaborative practice agreement with patrons' primary care providers. In  the control group, barbers promoted follow-up with primary care providers and  lifestyle modification. After BP assessment at 6 months, the intervention  continued with fewer in-person pharmacist visits to test whether the intervention  effect could be sustained safely for 1 year while reducing pharmacist travel  time. Final BP and safety outcomes were assessed in both groups at 12 months.  RESULTS: At baseline, mean systolic BP was 152.4 mm Hg in the intervention group  and 154.6 mm Hg in the control group. At 12 months, mean systolic BP fell by 28.6  mm Hg (to 123.8 mm Hg) in the intervention group and by 7.2 mm Hg (to 147.4  mm Hg) in the control group. The mean reduction was 20.8 mm Hg greater in the  intervention (95% CI, 13.9-27.7; P<0.0001). A BP <130/80 mm Hg was achieved by  68.0% of the intervention group versus 11.0% of the control group ( P<0.02).  These new 12-month efficacy data are statistically indistinguishable from our  previously reported 6-month data. No treatment-related serious adverse events  occurred in either group over 12 months. Cohort retention at 12 months was 90% in  both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among black male barbershop patrons with uncontrolled  hypertension, health promotion by barbers resulted in large and sustained BP  reduction over 12 months when coupled with medication management by American  Society of Hypertension-certified pharmacists. Broad-scale implementation  research is both justified and warranted. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL:  https://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Unique identifier: NCT 02321618.",

Uncontrolled HTN contributes significantly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is more frequently encountered among patients presenting to the ED as compared to the primary care setting. EDs serve as the point of entry into the health care system for high‐risk patient populations, including minority and low‐income patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of uncontrolled/undiagnosed HTN in patients presenting to the ED is alarmingly high. Thus ED engagement and early risk assessment/stratification is a feasible innovation to help close health disparity gaps in HTN. A Hypertension Emergency Department Intervention Aimed at Decreasing Disparities (AHEAD2) trial, funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is a three‐arm single site randomized clinical pilot trial of adults presenting to the ED with Stage 2 hypertension (blood pressure [BP]>160/100) comparing (1) an ED‐initiated Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral for Treatment (SBIRT) focused on HTN, (2) the same ED‐initiated SBIRT coupled with a Post‐Acute Care Hypertension Transition Consultation by ED Clinical Pharmacists, and (3) usual care. The primary outcome is mean BP differences between study arms. Secondary outcomes are proportion of participants with BP control (BP<140/90mmHg), and improvements in HTN knowledge and medication adherence scores between study arms.

Multidisciplinary efforts may  improve care for patients with chronic disease. Pharmacist based interventions  have effectively improved management of hypertension. We performed a pragmatic,  randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of a pharmacist based quality  improvement program on 1) outcomes for patients with CKD and 2) adherence to CKD  guidelines in the primary care setting. METHODS: Patients with moderate to severe  CKD receiving primary care services at one of thirteen community-based Veterans  Affairs outpatient clinics were randomized to a multifactorial intervention that  included a phone-based pharmacist intervention, pharmacist-physician  collaboration, patient education, and a CKD registry (n = 1070) or usual care  (n = 1129). The primary process outcome was measurement of parathyroid hormone  (PTH) during the one year study period. The primary clinical outcome was blood  pressure (BP) control in subjects with poorly controlled hypertension at  baseline. RESULTS: Among those with poorly controlled baseline BP, there was no  difference in the last recorded BP or the percent at goal BP during the study  period (42.0% vs. 41.2% in the control arm). Subjects in the intervention arm  were more likely to have a PTH measured during the study period (46.9% vs. 16.1%  in the control arm, P <0.001) and were on more classes of antihypertensive  medications at the end of the study (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: A one-time  pharmacist based intervention proved feasible in patients with CKD. While the  intervention did not improve BP control, it did improve guideline adherence and  increased the number of antihypertensive medications prescribed to subjects with  poorly controlled BP. These findings can inform the design of quality improvement  programs and future studies which are needed to improve care of patients with  CKD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01290614.",

Little is known about  whether physician organizations (POs) will retain the services of clinical  pharmacists after outside funding for a statewide implementation program is  ended. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a statewide program, Michigan Pharmacists  Transforming Care and Quality (MPTCQ), that incorporated pharmacists within 17  POs. METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted using data collected from June  2016 to September 2018 from primary care clinical pharmacist encounters in POs  participating in MPTCQ. Process outcomes included the number of participating  POs, patient encounters, and average visits per patient. Analyses at the  encounter level were stratified by 2 encounter types: disease state management  (DSM) or comprehensive medication review (CMR). Separately by encounter type,  pharmacist effect was described by the number, type, and reasons for medication  changes, as well as medication adherence and cost barriers found and addressed.  Clinical outcomes included hemoglobin A1c and blood pressure change.  Sustainability and patient satisfaction of pharmacists providing clinical  services are reported. RESULTS: Across 17 POs, 27 pharmacists participated in the  MPTCQ program. Pharmacists completed 24,523 patient encounters for DSM with 5,942  patients, with an average of 5 visits per patient with diabetes and 2 visits for  hypertension. Pharmacists made 15,153 therapeutic medication changes during  visits for diabetes and hypertension, with approximately 70% related to efficacy.  Pharmacists completed 4,203 CMR visits for 3,092 patients. During CMR visits,  1,296 therapeutic medication changes were recommended. Problems with medication  cost were identified in 13% of CMR visits. Blood pressure and A1c levels  decreased in patients managed by pharmacists. In 157 patients surveyed, 87% rated  their pharmacists' care as excellent. Sixteen POs retained their pharmacists at  the end of funding. CONCLUSIONS: A statewide provider-payer partnership  successfully integrated and retained primary care pharmacists within POs.

OBJECTIVE To test a multifaceted intervention to improve adherence to cardiac medications. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this randomized clinical trial, 253 patients from 4 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers located in Denver (Colorado), Seattle (Washington); Durham (North Carolina), and Little Rock (Arkansas) admitted with ACS were randomized to the multifaceted intervention (INT) or usual care (UC) prior to discharge. INTERVENTIONS The INT lasted for 1 year following discharge and comprised (1) pharmacist-led medication reconciliation and tailoring; (2) patient education; (3) collaborative care between pharmacist and a patient's primary care clinician and/or cardiologist; and (4) 2 types of voice messaging (educational and medication refill reminder calls). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome of interestwas proportion of patients adherent to medication regimens based on a mean proportion of days covered (PDC) greater than 0.80 in the year after hospital discharge using pharmacy refill data for 4 cardioprotective medications (clopidogrel, β-blockers, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors [statins], and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers [ACEI/ARB]). Secondary outcomes included achievement of blood pressure (BP) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level targets. RESULTS Of 253 patients, 241 (95.3%) completed the study (122 in INT and 119 in UC). In the INT group, 89.3%of patients were adherent compared with 73.9%in the UC group (P = .003). Mean PDC was higher in the INT group (0.94 vs 0.87; P< .001).

The implementation and outcomes of a program combining electronic home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) and pharmacist-provided medication therapy management (MTM) services in a renal transplantation clinic are described. Summary. Patients enrolled in the program were provided with a computer-enabled blood pressure monitor. A dedicated renal transplantation pharmacist was integrated into the renal transplantation team under a collaborative care practice agreement. The collaborative care agreement allowed the pharmacist to authorize medication additions, deletions, and dosage changes. Comprehensive disease and blood pressure education was provided by a clinical pharmacist. In the pretrans-plantation setting, the pharmacist interviewed the renal transplant candidate and documents allergies, verified the patient's medication profile, and identified and assessed barriers to medication adherence. A total of 50 renal transplant recipients with at least one recorded home blood pressure reading and at least one year of follow-up were included in our analysis. A significant reduction in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure values were observed at 30, 90,180, and 360 days after enrollment in the program (p < 0.05). Pharmacist interventions were documented for 37 patients. Medication-related problems accounted for 46% of these interventions and included dosage modifications, regimen changes, and mitigation of barriers to medication access and adherence. Conclusion. Implementation of electronic HBPM and pharmacist-provided MTM services implemented in a renal transplant clinic was associated with sustained improvements in blood pressure control. Incorporation of a pharmacist in the renal transplant clinic resulted in the detection and resolution of medication-related problems.",

Even though the term ""MTM"" was first used in 2003, pharmacists  have provided similar services since the term ""pharmaceutical care"" was  introduced in 1990. Fairview Health Services, a large integrated health care  system, implemented a standardized pharmaceutical care service system in 1998,  naming it a pharmaceutical care-based MTM practice in 2006. OBJECTIVE: To present  the clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes of 10 years of delivering MTM  services to patients in a health care delivery system. METHODS: Data from MTM  services provided to 9,068 patients and documented in electronic therapeutic  records were retrospectively analyzed over the 10-year period from September 1998  to September 2008 in 1 health system with 48 primary care clinics. Patients  eligible for MTM services were aged 21 years or older and either paid for MTM out  of pocket or met their health care payer's criteria for MTM reimbursement; the  criteria varied for Medicaid, Medicare, and commercially insured enrollees. All  MTM was delivered face to face. Health data extracted from the electronic  therapeutic record by the present study's investigators included patient  demographics, medication list, medical conditions, drug therapy problems  identified and addressed, change in clinical status, and pharmacist-estimated  cost savings. The clinical status assessment was a comparison of the first and  most recent MTM visit to measure whether the patient achieved the goals of  therapy for each medical condition (e.g., the blood pressure of a patient with  diabetes and hypertension will be less than 130/80 millimeters mercury [mmHg] in  1 month; the patient with allergic rhinitis will be relieved of his complaints of  nasal congestion, runny nose, and eye itching within 5 days). Goals were set  according to evidence-based literature and patient-specific targets determined  cooperatively by pharmacists, patients, and physicians. Cost-savings calculations  represented MTM pharmacists' estimates of medical services (e.g., office visits,  laboratory services, urgent care visits, emergency room visits) and lost work  time avoided by the intervention. All short-term (3-month) estimated health care  savings that resulted from addressing drug therapy problems were analyzed. The  expenses of these avoided services were calculated using the health system's  contracted rates for services provided in the last quarter of 2008. The return on  investment (ROI) was calculated by dividing the pharmacist-estimated savings by  the cost of MTM services in 2008 (number of MTM encounters times the average cost  of an MTM visit). The humanistic impact of MTM services was assessed using the  results from the second patient satisfaction survey administered in 2008 (new  patients seen from January through December 2008) for the health system's MTM  program. RESULTS: A total of 9,068 patient records were in the documentation  system as of September 30, 2008. During the 10-year period, there were 33,706  documented encounters (mean 3.7 encounters per patient). Of 38,631 drug therapy  problems identified and addressed by MTM pharmacists, the most frequent were a  need for additional drug therapy (n = 10,870, 28.1%) and subtherapeutic dosage (n  = 10,100, 26.1%). In the clinical status assessment of the 12,851 medical  conditions in 4,849 patients who were not at goal when they enrolled in the  program, 7,068 conditions (55.0%) improved, 2,956 (23.0%) were unchanged, and  2,827 (22.0%) worsened during the course of MTM services. Pharmacist-estimated  cost savings to the health system over the 10-year period were $2,913,850 ($86  per encounter) and the total cost of MTM was $2,258,302 ($67 per encounter), for  an estimated ROI of $1.29 per $1 in MTM administrative costs. In the patient  satisfaction survey, 95.3% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that their  overall health and well-being had improved because of MTM. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist  estimates of the impact of an MTM program in a large integrated health care  system suggest that the program was associated with improved clinical outcomes  and cost savings. Patient satisfaction with the program was high. DISCLOSURES:  There was no external funding for this manuscript. The 3 authors are employees of  Fairview Pharmacy Services.

Compelling statistics show higher readmission rates for under-insured patients compared with insured patients at primary health care clinics. Methods: This is a single center, prospective, cohort study designed to examine team-based collaborative drug therapy management and its effect on therapeutic outcomes of under-insured patients with target chronic diseases managed in a primary health center. Targeted chronic diseases included dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, anticoagulation disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure. The primary outcome measures included percentage of time in therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) and percentage of patients at targeted goals of blood pressure, lipids, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes included reduced emergency department visits, number of patient encounters, hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge, and disease exacerbation rates. Results: Patients were at INR goal 58% of the time compared with 52% at baseline (P =.66). There was a 9% improvement in mean HbA1c in the intervention group when compared with baseline (9.6% vs 10.9%, P =.03). With pharmacist intervention, 73.8% of the patients had their blood pressure at goal compared with 50% at baseline (P =.14). A limited number of patients were readmitted for different reasons, including uncontrolled disease states. Conclusions: The pharmacist-physician collaborative drug therapy management led to improved blood pressure control, average HbA1c, and time in therapeutic INR range. A decrease in health care utilization was also identified.",

Differences exist in the mode of delivery, location of services, type of  personnel involved in managing the service, and the subsequent outcomes. The type  and intensity of MTM services delivered have evolved with time to more  streamlined and robust interventions, necessitating ongoing evaluation of the  effect on clinical and economic outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of  changes to an existing MTM program on cost of care, utilization, and medication  adherence. METHODS: UPMC Health Plan made changes to an existing MTM program by  expanding eligibility (customized by the type of health plan), intervention  types, pharmacist involvement, and patient followup contacts. After matching our  intervention cohort (identified January 2017-June 2018) with the pre-2016 MTM  historical controls (patients identified January 2014-June 2015 who would have  been eligible if we used the intervention cohort eligibility criteria), we  estimated that the effect of the program changes with a difference-in-difference  model (preintervention [2014-2016] and postintervention [2017-2019]). Outcomes of  interest included cost (total cost of care including medical, pharmacy, and  unplanned care [i.e., unscheduled health care use such as emergency department  visits] in 2017 U.S. dollars); utilization; medication adherence (proportion of  days covered); and return on investment (ROI). Target population included  continuously enrolled patients aged ≥ 21 years in the commercial, Medicare, and  Medicaid health plans. RESULTS: Total propensity score-matched members was  10,747, 55% of which were in the historic control group. The average (SD) ages  after matching the groups were similar (historical control group: 57.08 years  [14.23], intervention group: 56.79 years [14.21]) and the majority was female  (57%). Comorbidities identified most for patients included hypertension (77%),  dyslipidemia (70%), and diabetes (52%). Forty-one percent were in the commercial,  37% in the Medicaid, and 23% in the Medicare health plans. Proportion of care  activities undertaken in the intervention period compared with the control period  were significantly different: ""sent letter to physician"" (67% vs. 87%), ""sent  letter to member"" (15% vs. 0%), ""pharmacist phone call to physician"" (15% vs.  0.1%), and ""pharmacist phone call to member"" (13% vs. 7%). There were  statistically significant reductions in unplanned care across all health plans  especially in the Medicare population, in total cost of care, and increases in  medication adherence in 4 therapeutic classes: anticoagulants (OR = 1.25, P =  0.005), cardiac medications (OR = 1.20, P < 0.001), statins (OR = 1.21, P <  0.001), and antidepressants (OR = 1.15, P < 0.001). There was a positive ROI of  $18.50 per dollar spent, which equated to a cumulative net savings of $11 million  over 24 months.

To improve CVD-associated outcomes, medication therapy management (MTM) services  have been included in essential health benefit packages offered by various health  plans. Nevertheless, the impact of such MTM services on outcomes is still  unclear, especially from the perspective of the self-insured employer.   OBJECTIVES: To (a) compare economic outcomes between patients who received and  those who did not receive MTM services from the self-insured employer's  perspective and (b) compare clinical outcomes before and after receiving MTM  services.  METHODS: This study consisted of 2 pre- and post-retrospective  designs: (1) a cohort study with comparison groups and (2) a cohort study within  group comparison. Patients were beneficiaries aged 19 years or older who were  diagnosed with CVD conditions according to ICD-9-CM codes and continuously  enrolled in a public university-sponsored insurance plan between 2008-2010.  Patients were divided into MTM and non-MTM groups. The first MTM encounter was  assigned as the index date for the MTM group. Match-paired patients who did not  receive MTM services were randomly assigned the index date based on age category,  gender, and comorbidity. Measures for pharmacy, medical, and total expenditures  were obtained from medical and pharmacy claims. Paired t-tests and independent  t-tests using data generated from 1000 bootstraps compared mean cost difference  within and between groups. The return on investment (ROI) was calculated by  dividing the average net benefit from MTM services by the average cost of MTM  services. Clinical parameters, including blood pressure (BP) and body mass index  (BMI), were retrieved from electronic medical records from a pharmacist-provided  clinic where MTM services took place. Paired-t tests were used to compare the  mean difference between baseline and endpoint values. Further, this study  examined changes in the proportion of patients who achieved an individualized  treatment goal for BP and BMI. The study also quantified the improvement in  disease stages after the index date using the McNemar's test. Statistical  analyses were performed by using SAS software version 9.2 with statistical  significance level of 0.05.   RESULTS: A total of 63 patients and 62 match-paired  patients were included in the MTM group and the non-MTM group, respectively. The  mean cost (SD) per patient in the MTM group during the 6 months post-index period  for CVD-related pharmacy, all-cause medical, and total expenditures was lower  than the 6 months pre-index period by $22.0 (19.1), $79.2 (99.6), and $75.1  (136.2), respectively. In contrast, the mean cost (SD) for the non-MTM group  increased during the 6 months post-index date by $10.7 (24.2), $246.4 (248.4),  and $289.0 (269.5) for pharmacy, medical, and total  expenditure, respectively.  When comparing the 2 groups, the MTM group had statistically significantly lower  costs per patient for pharmacy expenditures (difference of -31.9 ± 25.1, P  less  than  0.0001), medical expenditures (difference of -$325.6 ± 271.2, P  less than  0.0001), and total direct expenditures (difference of -$359.3 ± 219.2, P  less  than  0.0001). Given the net benefit of MTM services ($359.3) and the average  cost of MTM service ($134.6), the ROI was $1.67 per $1 in MTM cost. Regarding  clinical outcomes, while no statistically significant differences were observed  in clinical outcomes, MTM services demonstrated clinical benefits. At the  post-index period, the percentage of patients who had achieved their goals  increased from 55% to 70% for BP and from 13.0% to 21.7% for normal BMI compared  with the pre-index period. In terms of the extent of improvement in disease  stages, clinical improvements in the stages of hypertension (χ2 =12.77, P  less  than  0.05) as well as BMI (χ2 =6.39, P  less than  0.05) at the endpoint were  observed.  CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular-related pharmacy, all-cause medical, and  total expenditures were statistically lower among beneficiaries who received MTM  services compared with those who did not. In addition, MTM services had a  positive ROI and demonstrated clinical significances by the increasing number of  patients who achieved treatment goals and improved disease stages for  hypertension and BMI.",

Cassandra; Dobbs, Thomas; Hites, Lisle","INTRODUCTION: The Mississippi Delta has high rates of chronic disease and is known for its poor health outcomes and health disparities. The University of  Mississippi School of Pharmacy (UMSOP) and the Mississippi State Department of  Health partnered in 2009 through the Mississippi Delta Health Collaborative to  reduce health disparities and improve clinical outcomes by expanding the UMSOP's  evidence-based medication therapy management (MTM) initiative, focused in  Mississippi's 18-county Delta region, to federally qualified health centers  (FQHCs) in 4 of those counties. METHODS: Between January 2009 and August 2018,  the MTM initiative targeted FQHC patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis  of diabetes, hypertension, and/or dyslipidemia. Pharmacists initially met  face-to-face with patients to review all medications, provide education about  chronic diseases, identify and resolve drug therapy problems, and take  appropriate actions to help improve the effectiveness of medication therapies.  Clinical parameters evaluated were systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood  pressure (DBP), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol,  triglycerides, and hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)). RESULTS: The analysis included 335  patients with hypertension (n = 287), dyslipidemia (n = 131), and/or diabetes (n  = 331). Significant mean reductions occurred in the following metrics: SBP (7.1  mm Hg), DBP (6.3 mm Hg), LDL cholesterol (24.9 mg/dL), triglycerides (45.5  mg/dL), total cholesterol (37.7 mg/dL), and HbA(1c) (1.6% [baseline ≥6%] and 1.9%  [baseline ≥9%]). CONCLUSION: Despite the cultural and environmental disadvantages  present in the Mississippi Delta, the integrated MTM treatment program  demonstrated significant health improvements across 3 chronic diseases:  hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. This model demonstrates that a  partnership between public health and pharmacy is a successful and innovative  approach to care.",

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study  with patient enrollment, medication consultation and adjustment, remote BP  monitoring, and follow-up at 6 months. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial  was conducted at 3 healthcare systems in Denver, Colorado, including a large  health maintenance organization, a Veterans Affairs medical center, and a county  hospital. At each site, patients with uncontrolled BP were randomized to the  multimodal intervention vs usual care for 6 months, with the primary end point of  BP reduction. RESULTS: Of 338 patients randomized, 283 (84%) completed the study,  including 138 intervention patients and 145 usual care patients. Baseline BP was  higher in the intervention group vs the usual care group (150.5/89.4 vs  143.8/85.3 mm Hg). At 6 months, BPs were similar in the intervention group vs the  usual care group (137.4 vs 136.7 mm Hg, P = .85 for systolic; 82.9 vs 81.1 mm Hg,  P = .14 for diastolic).

Practical, robust and sustainable models are needed to improve BP in patients  with uncontrolled hypertension. OBJECTIVES: The Home Blood Pressure  Telemonitoring and Case Management to Control Hypertension study (HyperLink) is a  cluster-randomized trial designed to determine whether an intervention that  combines home BP telemonitoring with pharmacist case management improves BP  control compared to usual care at 6 and 12 months in patients with uncontrolled  hypertension. Secondary outcomes are maintenance of BP control at 18 months,  patient satisfaction with their health care, and costs of care. METHODS:  HyperLink enrolled 450 hypertensive patients with uncontrolled BP from 16 primary  care clinics. Eight clinics were randomized to provide usual care (UC) to their  patients (n=222) and 8 were randomized to provide the telemonitoring intervention  (TI) (n=228). TI patients received home BP telemonitors that internally store and  electronically transmit BP data to a secure database. Pharmacist case managers  adjust antihypertensive therapy based on the home BP data under a collaborative  practice agreement with the clinics' primary care teams. The length of the  intervention is 12 months, with follow-up to 18 months to determine the  durability of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: We will test in a real primary care  setting whether combining BP telemonitoring and pharmacist case management can  achieve and maintain high rates of BP control compared to usual care.",

Objective: We conducted a mediation analysis to determine which of seven factors had the greatest effect on change in systolic blood pressure (BP) after 6 months in a trial to improve hypertension control. Design: The study was a preplanned secondary analysis of a cluster‐randomized clinical trial. Eight clinics in an integrated health system were randomized to provide usual care to their patients (n = 222), and eight were randomized to provide a telemonitoring intervention (n = 228). Participants: Four hundred three of 450 trial participants completing the 6‐month follow‐up visit were included. Interventions: Intervention group participants received home BP telemonitors and transmitted measurements to pharmacists, who adjusted medications and provided advice to improve adherence to medications and lifestyle modification via telephone visits. Main measures: Path analytic models estimated indirect effects of the seven potential mediators of intervention effect (defined as the difference between the intervention and usual care groups in change in systolic BP from baseline to 6 months). The potential mediators were change in home BP monitor use, number of BP medication classes, adherence to BP medications, physical activity, salt intake, alcohol use, and weight. Key Results: The difference in change in systolic BP was 11.3 mmHg. The multivariable mediation model explained 47 % (5.3 mmHg) of the intervention effect. Nearly all of this was mediated by two factors: an increase in medication treatment intensity (24 %) and increased home BP monitor use (19 %). The other five factors were not significant mediators, although medication adherence and salt intake improved more in the intervention group than in the usual care group. Conclusions: Most of the explained intervention effect was attributable to the combination of self‐monitoring and medication intensification. High adherence at baseline and the relatively low intensity of resources directed toward lifestyle change may explain why these factors did not contribute to the improvement in BP.",

Our study aim was to test a medication therapy management intervention to reduce subsequent acute care utilization. Design, setting, participants, & measurements The CKD Medication Intervention Trial was a single-blind (investigators), randomized clinical trial conducted at Providence Health Care in Spokane, Washington. Patients with CKD stages 3–5 not treated by dialysis who were hospitalized for acute illness were recruited. The intervention was designed to improve posthospitalization care by medication therapy management. A pharmacist delivered the intervention as a single home visit within 7 days of discharge. The intervention included these fundamental elements: comprehensive medication review, medication action plan, and a personal medication list. The primary outcome was a composite of acute care utilization (hospital readmissions and emergency department and urgent care visits) for 90 days after hospitalization. Results Baseline characteristics of participants (n=141) included the following: age, 69±11 (mean±SD) years old women, 48% (67 of 141) diabetes, 56%(79 of 141) hypertension, 83% (117 of 141) eGFR, 41±14 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (serum creatinine–based Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio median, 43 mg/g (interquartile range, 8–528) creatinine. The most common primary diagnoses for hospitalization were the following: cardiovascular events, 36% (51 of 141); infections, 18% (26 of 141); and kidney diseases, 12% (17 of 141). The primary outcome occurred in 32 of 72 (44%) of the medication intervention group and 28 of 69 (41%) of those in usual care (log rank P=0.72). For only hospital readmission, the rate was 19 of 72 (26%) in the medication intervention group and 18 of 69 (26%) in the usual care group (log rank P=0.95). There was no between-group difference in achievement of guideline-based goals for use of renin-angiotensin system inhibition or for BP, hemoglobin, phosphorus, or parathyroid hormone. Conclusions Acute care utilization after hospitalization was not reduced by a pharmacist-led medication therapy management intervention at the transition from hospital to home.",

METHODS: This quasi-experimental study  evaluated the effectiveness of an adherence program at an independent community  pharmacy. Patients who met inclusion criteria were telephoned monthly to answer  questions related to their medications. Patients served as their own controls to  show comparison between pre- and postintervention adherence rates calculated  according to proportion of days covered over the previous 6 months. Mean  medication adherences before and after intervention were assessed via paired t  test. Linear regression was used to analyze predictors of average medication  adherence. The Charlson Comorbidity Index was used to measure the impact of  comorbid conditions on medication adherence. RESULTS: Fifty-six of 354 patients  met inclusion criteria, consented, and completed the study. The percentage of  patients achieving an adherence rate of 80% or more increased from 9% initially  to 59% at study completion. Each medication class showed improvement in adherence  rates: diabetes from 66.24% to 80.06% (P = 0.0153), hypertension from 72.33% to  81.34% (P = 0.0192), and hyperlipidemia from 64.45% to 74.66% (P = 0.0103).  Overall, average medication adherence increased by 11% (P < 0.0001). The top  patient-reported barrier to adherence was convenience/forgetfulness (46.43%).  CONCLUSION: Pharmacist-led counseling sessions with the use of the 3 prime  questions showed short-term improvement in adherence rates among patients  participating in a medication adherence program. Future studies should assess if  improved adherence is sustained long-term following active intervention.",
92357210,https://sysrev.com/p/121730/article/92357210,A Markov model of the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist care for diabetes in prevention of cardiovascular diseases: evidence from Kaiser Permanente Northern  California.,J Manag Care Pharm,"Yu, Junhua; Shah, Bijal M.; Ip, Eric J.; Chan, James","BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated in previous studies that pharmacist management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the outpatient  setting not only improves diabetes-related clinical outcomes such as hemoglobin  A1c but also blood pressure (BP), total cholesterol (TC), and quality of life.  Improved control of BP and TC has been shown to reduce the risks of  cardiovascular disease (CVD), which has placed a heavy economic burden on the  health care system. However, no study has evaluated the cost-effectiveness of  pharmacist intervention programs with respect to the long-term preventive effects  on CVD outcomes among T2DM patients. OBJECTIVES: To (a) quantify the long-term  preventive effects of pharmacist intervention on CVD outcomes among T2DM patients  using evidence from a matched cohort study in the outpatient primary care setting  and (b) assess the relative cost-effectiveness of adding a clinical pharmacist to  the primary care team for the management of patients with T2DM based on  improvement in CVD risks with the aid of an economic model. METHODS: Clinical  data between the periods of June 2007 to February 2010 were collected from  electronic medical records at 2 separate clinics at Kaiser Permanente (KP)  Northern California, 1 with primary care physicians only (control group) and the  other with the addition of a pharmacist (enhanced care group). Patients in the  enhanced care group were matched 1:1 with patients in the control group according  to baseline characteristics that included age, gender, A1c, and Charlson  comorbidity score. The estimated 10-year CVD risk for both groups was calculated  by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine (version 2)  based on age, sex, race, smoking status, atrial fibrillation, duration of  diabetes, levels of A1c, systolic BP (SBP) and TC, and high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol (HDL-C) observed at 12 months. There was no statistical difference in  the baseline clinical inputs to the Risk Engine (A1c [P=0.115], SBP [P=0.184], TC  [P=0.055], and HDL-C [P=0.475]) between the 2 groups. A Markov model was  developed to simulate the estimated CVD outcomes over 10 years and to estimate  cost-effectiveness. The final outcomes examined included incremental cost and  effectiveness measured by life years and per quality-adjusted life year gained.  Both deterministic sensitivity analysis (SA) and probabilistic SA were conducted  to examine the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The estimated risks for  coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke (both nonfatal and fatal) at the end of  the follow-up were consistently lower in the enhanced care group compared with  the control group, even though baseline risks in both groups were similar. The  absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the enhanced care and control groups  increased over time. For example, the ARR for nonfatal CHD risk in year 1 was  0.5% (1.2% vs. 0.7%), whereas the ARR increased to 5.5% in year 10 (14.8% vs.  9.3%). Similarly, the ARR between the enhanced care and the control groups was  calculated as 0.3% for fatal CHD in year 1 and increased to 4.6% in year 10.  Results from the Markov model suggest that the enhanced care group was shown to  be a dominant strategy (less expensive and more effective) compared with the  control group in the 10-year evaluation period in the base-case (average or mean  results) scenario. Sensitivity analysis that took into account the uncertainty in  all important variables, such as wage of pharmacists, utility weight (the degree  of preference individuals have for a particular health state or condition),  response rate to pharmacists' care, and uncertainty associated with the estimated  10 years of CVD risk, revealed that the relative value of enhanced care was  robust to most of the variations in these parameters. Notably, the level of  cost-effectiveness measured by net monetary value depends on the time horizon  adopted by the payers and the magnitude of CVD risk reduction. The enhanced care  group has a higher chance of being considered as a cost-effective strategy when a  longer time horizon such as a minimum of 4 to 5 years is adopted. CONCLUSIONS:  Adding pharmacists to the health care management team for diabetic patients  improves the long-term CVD risks. The longer-term CVD risk reductions were shown  to be more dramatic than the short-term reduction. A longer time horizon adopted  by health plans in managing T2DM patients has a higher probability of making the  intervention cost-effective.",

METHODS: Randomized-controlled-trial in  three US Veteran Health Administration (VHA) Hospitals, where 250 patients with  T2DM, HbA1c >7% and either hypertension, active smoking or hyperlipidemia were  randomized to either (1) addition of pharmacist-led group-medical-visits or (2)  standard care alone for 13 months. Group (4-6 patients) visits consisted of  2-hour, education and comprehensive medication management sessions once weekly  for 4 weeks, followed by quarterly visits. Change from baseline in cardiovascular  risk estimated by the UKPDS-risk-score, health-related quality-of-life (SF36v)  and institutional healthcare costs were compared between study arms. RESULTS:  After 13 months, both groups had similar and significant improvements from  baseline in UKPDS-risk-score (-0.02 ±0.09 and -0.04 ±0.09, group visit and  standard care respectively, adjusted p<0.05 for both); however, there was no  significant difference between the study arms (adjusted p = 0.45). There were no  significant differences on improvement from baseline in A1c,  systolic-blood-pressure, and LDL as well as health-related quality-of-life  measures between the study arms. Compared to 13 months prior, the increase in  per-person outpatient expenditure from baseline was significantly lower in the  group visit versus the standard care arm, both during the study intervention  period and at 13-months after study interventions. The overall VHA healthcare  costs/person were comparable between the study arms during the study period (p =  0.15); then decreased by 6% for the group visit but increased by 13% for the  standard care arm 13 months post-study (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Addition of  pharmacist-led group medical visits in T2DM achieved similar improvements from  baseline in cardiovascular risk factors than usual care, but with reduction in  the healthcare costs in the group visit arm 13 months after completion compared  to the steady rise in cost for the usual care arm.

Pharmacists are an accessible community healthcare resource and are  equipped with clinical skills to improve the management of hypertension through  medication therapy management (MTM). Nevertheless, current reimbursement models  do not incentivize pharmacists to provide clinical services. We aim to  investigate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist-led comprehensive MTM clinic  compared with no clinic for 10-year primary prevention of stroke and  cardiovascular disease events in patients with hypertension. METHODS: We built a  semi-Markov model to evaluate the clinical and economic consequences of an MTM  clinic compared with no MTM clinic, from the payer perspective. The model was  populated with data from a recently published controlled observational study  investigating the effectiveness of an MTM clinic. Methodology was guided using  recommendations from the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and  Medicine, including appropriate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared with no  MTM clinic, the MTM clinic was cost-effective with an incremental  cost-effectiveness ratio of $38 798 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.  The incremental net monetary benefit was $993 294 considering a  willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY. Health-benefit benchmarks at  $100 000 per QALY and $150 000 per QALY translate to a 95% and 170% increase from  current reimbursement rates for MTM services. CONCLUSIONS: Our model shows  current reimbursement rates for pharmacist-led MTM services may undervalue the  benefit realized by US payers. New reimbursement models are needed to allow  pharmacists to offer cost-effective clinical services.",

This trial involved 32 medical offices in 15 states. A clinical pharmacist was  embedded within each office and made recommendations to physicians and patients  in intervention offices. The purpose of the present analysis was to evaluate  whether the pharmacist intervention could reduce healthcare disparities by  improving blood pressure in high-risk racial and socioeconomic subjects compared  with the control group. The analyses in minority subjects were prespecified  secondary analyses, but all other comparisons were secondary, post hoc analyses.  The 9-month visit was completed by 539 patients: 345 received the intervention,  and 194 were in the control group. Following the intervention, mean systolic  blood pressure was found to be 7.3 mm Hg (95% confidence interval 2.4, 12.3)  lower in subjects from racial minority groups who received the intervention  compared with the control group (P=0.0042). Subjects with ≤12 years of education  in the intervention group had a systolic blood pressure 8.1 mm Hg (95% confidence  interval 3.2, 13.1) lower than the control group with lower education (P=0.0001).  Similar reductions in blood pressure occurred in patients with low incomes, those  receiving Medicaid, or those without insurance. This study demonstrated that a  pharmacist intervention reduced racial and socioeconomic disparities in the  treatment of blood pressure. Although disparities in blood pressure were reduced  by the intervention, there were still nonsignificant gaps in mean systolic blood  pressure when compared with intervention subjects not at risk.

DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial.  SETTING: 28 chain pharmacies (14 TEAM and 14 control) in five Wisconsin cities  from December 2006 to February 2009. PARTICIPANTS: 576 black patients with  hypertension. INTERVENTION: Trained pharmacist-technician teams implemented a  6-month intervention using scheduled visits, Brief Medication Questionnaires  (BMQs), and novel toolkits for facilitating medication adherence and pharmacist  feedback to patients and physicians. Control participants received patient  information only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Refill adherence (≥80% days covered) and  changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and blood  pressure control using blinded assessments at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: At  baseline, all patients had blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or more. Of those  eligible, 79% activated the intervention (mean 4.25 visits).

Medication and behavioral nonadherence are significant barriers to successful hypertension, hyperlidemia, and diabetes management. Our objective was to describe the theoretical framework underlying a tailored behavioral and educational pharmacist‐administered intervention for achieving CVD risk reduction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults with poorly controlled hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia were enrolled from three outpatient primary care clinics associated with the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Durham, NC). Participants were randomly assigned to receive a pharmacist‐administered, tailored, 1‐year telephone‐based intervention or usual care. The goal of the study was to reduce the risk for CVD through a theory‐driven intervention to increase medication adherence and improve health behaviors. RESULTS: Enrollment began in November 2011 and is ongoing. The target sample size is 500 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The Cardiovascular Intervention Improvement Telemedicine Study (CITIES) intervention has been designed with a strong theoretical underpinning. The theoretical foundation and intervention are designed to encourage patients with multiple comorbidities and poorly controlled CVD risk factors to engage in home‐based monitoring and tailored telephone‐based interventions.

PATIENTS: 239 patients with poorly controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A(1c) [HbA(1c)] level > or =7.5%) and hypertension (systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg). INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned within each center to either attend a GMC or receive usual care. Clinics comprised 7 to 8 patients and a care team that consisted of a primary care general internist, a pharmacist, and a nurse or other certified diabetes educator. Each session included structured group interactions moderated by the educator. The pharmacist and physician adjusted medication to manage each patient's HbA(1c) level and blood pressure. MEASUREMENTS: Hemoglobin A(1c) level and systolic blood pressure, measured by blinded research personnel at baseline, study midpoint (median, 6.8 months), and study completion (median follow‐up, 12.8 months). Linear mixed models, adjusted for clustering within GMCs, were used to compare HbA(1c) levels and systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: Mean baseline systolic blood pressure and HbA(1c) level were 152.9 mm Hg (SD, 14.2) and 9.2% (SD, 1.4), respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To assess telephonic- and community-based  clinical pharmacy services in improving health indicators for rural, underserved  patients. METHODS: In 2014, an established MTM provider created a novel,  collaborative pilot program with independent retail and community health center  pharmacies to provide comprehensive, telephonic MTM services to rural Arizonans.  This pilot program used a combined telephonic- and community-based pharmacist  approach in the provision of MTM services for rural, underserved Arizona  populations. Adults with diabetes mellitus and/or hypertension, seen by a  prescriber or who filled prescriptions at a contracted, rural facility in 2014,  were eligible to participate. Initial MTM telephonic consultations were  conducted, and recommendations were communicated to patients' prescribers and/or  pharmacists. Patients received a follow-up telephone call at standard intervals,  depending on risk severity. RESULTS: A total of 517 patients participated, and  237 medication-related and 1,102 health promotion interventions were completed.  Positive trends were observed in fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose, and  diastolic blood pressure. Broad variation in prescriber acceptance of pharmacist  recommendations was observed (27%-60%). CONCLUSIONS: Study results provide  initial evidence to support the efficacy of collaborative efforts in the  provision of MTM services for improving health indicators and safety measures  while potentially reducing health care disparities.
