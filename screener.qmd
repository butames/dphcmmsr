# Introduction

![](images/iconscout_direction.svg){fig-align="right" width=10%}

We are conducting a systematic review of the literature on pharmacist-led comprehensive medication management (CMM) interventions in populations living with hypertension. After searching several databases, we have compiled a list of citations or references that could theoretically be included in our analysis. We need to screen these citations to ensure that they have a basic level information, before we go through the challenge of extracting data for analysis. This guide will provide some of the basic information to carry out this screening process. Furthermore, it will provide information on using the SysRev Platform, a web-based tool to help us work together to mine data from our corpus of citations/references and eventually the full-text.


## Supporting Documents

![](images/iconscout_documents.svg){fig-align="left" width=20%}


1.    Systematic Review Protocol - This document represents the protocol for our systematic review. It details our study objectives, methods, and rationale for our approach. 

2.    Inclusion Criteria - While working to screen a corpus it can be handy to have a list of inclusion criteria to work with. This document is meant to assist with the process.

3.    Screening Cheat Sheet - This is an accompanying document that hopefully answers some of the more subtle questions you may have during screening. The training presentation and the protocol document also capture much of this information.



## The SysRev Platform

![](images/SysRev_logo.png){fig-align="center" width=20%}

The SysRev Platform (developed by Insillica, LLC.). The platform allows our team to work collaboratively (with the assistance of natural language processing and machine learning) to extract data and information for our systematic review. To begin using SysRev, you will need to create an account (if you have already created one, please skip to step 2).

![](images/sysrev_signup.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> [SysRev Signup](https://sysrev.com/register) - <https://sysrev.com/register></h3>

-   Click on the Sign up for SysRev button (alternatively copy and paste the above link into your browser).
-   Use a preferred email address and password (There is an option to sign up with a Google.com (i.e., Gmail) account if that works better for you in terms of keeping track of username and password information).
-   Once you sign-up you will have to **verify** your email address to ensure that your account is activated (SysRev is free to use, so no worries about making any payments).

## Launching a Project

![](images/iconscout_launch.svg){fig-align="right" width=10%}

You are able to start your own projects within the Platform. However, to get started with this project, I have to invite you to projects that I have created. Take the following steps to ensure you are invited to the correct projects so we may proceed.

1.    Once you complete your sign-up, inform me and I can invite you to the projects. That process won’t take long. You will get an email from me (Email: <sbutame@ph.lacounty.gov>) with a link to a SysRev project. 

2.    That project will be titled — *Training-Stage1-TitlesAbstract* (Or something similar). This guide contains images that are meant to serve as a guide to what you will interract with as you use the SysRev Platorm. There may be some variation in the names of the spefic projects that you encounter, and as we move forward with screening and eventually data extraction.

3.    When you receive the email from me, sign-in to your SysRev account, and then click on the link (within the email). If you have any trouble with this portion, please let me know.

## SysRev Layout

![](images/iconscout_webdesigning.svg){fig-align="left" width=10%}

Once you’ve accepted the project invitation, you will see all the projects you have accepted listed to the left of the landing page, under **Your Projects**.

![](images/sysrev_layout.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

To begin, select the relevant project. On clicking the specific project, you will have access to a similar project menu shown below. This menu gives you access to five items:

1.    **Overview** Page -- A project summary, summary statistics and summary information on the project.

2.    **Articles** Page -- A listing of the data (or articles/citations) that have been uploaded to the project.

3.    **Data** Page -- A summary page on the project data.

4.    **Users** Page -- Information about project collaborators and colleagues.

5.    **Analytics** Page -- Indepth statistics on the project and progress of collaborators (only accessible by the administrator).

6.    **Review** Page -- Information on what remains to be done for the project (A blank page means nothing left to do).

![](images/sysrev_projectmenu.svg){fig-align="center" width=100%}

### Overview Page

The **Overview** page gives a short explanation of the project, research question and the criteria we are using for screening or extracting data.

![SysRev - Project Overview page Part I](images/sysrev_overviewa.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

This page also displays a series of boxes, to provide summary on the data you and your collaborators will extract from citations/references.

-   The Review Status box will show how far along you have come in terms of citations or articles reviewed, whether you chose to include or exclude them etc. 
-   The Project Document box contains PDF copies of the study protocol and a separate list of the **Inclusion/Exclusion** criteria. Review these to help with your work.
-   The *Prediction Histogram* box will present information on your progress. As I mentioned earlier, the SysRev Platform employs machine learning and natural language processing in the background as you work attempting to predict your coding patterns and that of the project team.
-   Finally, the *Important Terms* box, also employs the machine learning functions to provide some summary information on the citations and references we are screening. 

Once you begin screening citations, this page may look someting similar to the below, populated with data interpreted by the platform.

![SysRev Project Overview page Part II (Featured project Wb literature review - Stage 3 Data extraction](images/sysrev_overviewb.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

### Articles Page

The **Articles** page provides a list of the citations/references uploaded into the project. There are several ways to load the citation corpus into SysRev. At present you don't need to worry about this process. When you are ready to begin screeing, you will find all the necessary data listed in this section. 

![SysRev Project Articles page](images/sysrev_articles.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

### Data Page

The Data page will provide a summary of those citations/references and the changes you and your fellow reviewers have made to each in terms of coding (I will explain further). As you can see from the image below it is similar to the **Articles Page** but is optimized for manipulating labels and exporting data. Only the project administrators have access to the data here.

![SysRev Data page](images/sysrev_data.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

### Analytics Page

The Analytics page is closed off to you. Just note that it provides based on your coding and screen activity (It is not pertinent to our screening activity). As with the data page, only the project administrators have access to the data here.

![SysRev Analytics page](images/sysrev_analytics.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

### Review Page

As you are working through screening or reviewing the citations in the corpus, the Review page will indicate how many citations (manuscripts) are left to you. 

### Additional Information

If you want some additional information on the SysRev Platform for your own work, Insillica LLC, owners of SysRev provide some instructional videos.

# Title and Abstract Screening

The objective at this point is to give a first pass of all the references we have gathered to ensure that they have a basic level of information necessary for the systematic review. This systematic review has two important steps before we begin extracting data. The first is Title and Abstract Screening.The objective is to efficiently scan the titles and the abstracts (if available) of the citations and to mark them as Include or Exclude based on the criteria detailed in the protocol.

new Runtime().module(define, name => {

});
</script>
```


## Getting Started

We have already had an introduction to SysRev, so it is time to dive on in.

1.    Log-in to your account
2.    You will see projects listed in your profile by name (if I have invited you to a project).
3.    Click on the project (e.g., Stage1-TitlesAbstracts) to access the landing page described above.
4.    To begin, click on **Review Page** tab.![](images/sysrev_reviewbutt.png?display=inline-block)


The Platform will feed you the next unscreened citation/reference in the list. The landing window will be as follows:

-   On the left, you will see a listing of labels.

-   On the right you will see the citations including: Title, Journal, Publication year, Authors, and Abstract (if available). 

![Getting started with a review](images/sysrev_reviewa.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

To begin, read and review citation/reference information on the right and then move to the **Labels** panel on the left. There are two questions in the **Labels** panel and you will have to provide responses to both. The first section is **Include**. Here you have to decide whether to 

-   Include![](images/sysrev_yes.png?display=inline-block) 

<p align="center"; font-size=16>or</p>

-   Excluded![](images/sysrev_no.png?display=inline-block) 

Note that this is a REQUIRED question.

If you decide to Include (i.e., YES),  move to the Exclude tab. And from the drop down menu select a Not Applicable (i.e., the first item in the dropdown menu). 

If you decide to Exclude (i.e., NO), move to the Exclude tab. And from the drop down menu select your reason (or reasons for exclusion). Note that you are able to provide multiple reasons for exclusion, so select all that apply.

Providing a response in the Exclude tab is REQUIRED.


Once these two steps are complete, you click on Save.![](images/sysrev_save.png?display=inline-block) 

And just like that you are done with screening a citation/reference. The SysRev Platform will immediately deliver the next citation/reference in the system to be screened. Repeat the steps outlined above, deciding whether to Include or Exclude the citation.

When you first come across a citation/reference in Sysrev, you  have the option to **Skip**.![](images/sysrev_skip.png?display=inline-block)


When screening, at times you may be unsure and desire to to maul over the material before you make a decision. The Skip option gives you that breathing room.

The Skip, will place the citation/reference you are looking at the back of your list, and present you with the next on your list. You will eventually have to screen that citation/ reference.

### Screening Checks

There are features within SysRev to ensure that you follow the steps outlined above. If you decide to include a citation/reference (i.e., you select YES), your choice will produce a green plus sign in the upper left corner of the Include tab.![](images/sysrev_plus.png?display=inline-block)

If you decide to Exclude a citation/reference (i.e., you select NO), your choice will produce an orange munus sign in the upper left corner of the Include tab.![](images/sysrev_minus.png?display=inline-block)

Similarly, when you select **Not Applicable** in the Exclude tab, a green plus appears in the upper left of that tab. And when you select a reason explaining why chose to Exclude, a small orange minus sign appears in the same spot.

Consequently, if you are going to Include a citation you should see two green plus signs. 

![A decision to Include should show two green plus signs](images/sysrev_include.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

However, if your responses are mismatched, the entire section will take on a reddish color, to alert you to a problem. 


![A reddish color indicates you have entered incorrect values.](images/sysrev_mismatch.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

![A decision to Exclude should show two minus signs and the tabs should be highlighted a dull red](images/sysrev_include.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

As you screen, you want one of the two scenarios shown below. Either there should be two green plus signs, indicating a decision to Include, or two orange minus signs, indicating a decision to Exclude.

### Questions and Notes

As you are screening Titles/Abstracts, if you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me (Email: <sbutame@ph.lacounty.gov>). Alternatively you may note any questions you have in the SysRev Platform. Under each citation/ reference in the Review page there is a space to enter notes. 

![An option to ask questions or give notes](images/sysrev_questions.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

### One Last Note

If after reviewing the title and abstract of a citation, and you remain uncertain, default to **Including** the citation. The second pass at screening (i.e., Full-Text Screening) will help to resolve uncertainties given you will have access to critical context from the full-text.


<div class="page-break"></div>


# Full-text Screening

The objective at this point is to take a second pass at the remaining citations/ references. In the first stage all of the citations you marked as Include, have been moved to this project. In reviewing these citations, we review the Titles, Abstracts and the manuscript's full-text to ensure that the reference has a baseline of the information, that matches our study needs. That is it meets the **Inclusion criteria** we outlined in our protocol.

Often, a review of just the title or the abstract may miss some information. Both the title and abstracts focus on engagement, and highlight what an author thinks of as important. Consequently, they may not show all the desired information. Reviewing the full-text then ensures that additional context is not lost in trying to sift through the search results. As with the first part, our goal is to quickly scan the available material. You don’t have to read the full-text in detail, the goal is to scan relevant sections of the manuscript to ensure that it has the required key elements we need for our systematic review.

new Runtime().module(define, name => {
  if (name === "fulltxt") return new Inspector(document.querySelector("#observablehq-fulltxt-9175b58d"));
});
</script>

```

## Getting Started

As with the Title/Abstract screening we follow similar steps:

1.    Log-in to your account and accept project invitation.
2.    Once the invitation is accepted, you will see a project **CMMSR-FullTextScreening** listed under your projects.
3.    Click on the project to access the landing page.
4.    To begin full text screening, click on the **Review page**.![](images/sysrev_reviewbutt.png?display=inline-block)


The SysRev Platform when used for full-text screening is nearly identical to the project for Title/abstract screening. However because a pdf documents has been added to the project there are a few new features.

![Review page with attached pdf](images/sysrev_reviewb.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

The main thing you will notice is the ability to toggle between just the text of the abstract and the uploaded pdf document. If you scroll to the bottom, you also have the opportunity to download the article, should you wish to view it in a separate window.

When you toggle to the pdf document, your screen will look like the below.


![Review page toggled to pdf document](images/sysrev_reviewc.svg){fig-align="center" width=75%}

There are several options and navigation tools once you toggle to the document. These include:
-   Panel button to view document pages at left.
-   Controls button to view added buttons in th
-   Zoom controls to expand or minimize the document pages
-   A Pan button to move individual pages.
-   A select tool to be highlight and select text in the document
-   A search option to be able to search the text of the document.
-   Menu button to view other options such as printing, or downloading the document as a pdf.

## Full-text Screening Tips and 

At this stage you are still just screening the materials, so try not to get bogged down reading through the text of the manuscript. Alternatively, try not feel intimidated by the amount of information you are observing. The way to get through this is:

1. Confirm that the document you are looking at, matches the title and abstract information.[^1] That is check items like the title, date of publication and the author list, and quickly scan through the text of the abstract. Firstly this will ensure that the uploaded document matches the earlier information. Secondly, a look through the title and abstract will help ease your workload. There are seven (7) inclusion criteria. A quick glance through the existing information, will ensure that your only looking through the full-text for one or two of the criteria.

2. Quickly scan through the document to make sure it meets all the inclusion criteria. Much or all of the information we need to assess the inclusion criteria will be found in the **Methods Section** of the paper. Fortunately, scientific journals are diligent about labeling sections. So, scroll down to the methods section and confirm the some or all of the inclusion criteria there.

3. Then select your responses as you did with title and abstract screening using the Labels Panel in Sysrev. If you decide to include the systematic review (i.e., **YES**) make sure to select **Not Applicable** under Exclusion. If you decide that we should exclude it from our systematic review (i.e., **NO**) be sure to select your reasons under Exclusion.


### Making Screening Easier

1. Start with the easily verifiable criteria, and save the more difficult for last. In particular verify the following for criteria first.

    -   Publication year (i.e., after 2010) -- You can verify this information by looking at the  publication metadata typically found under the author and title information.
  
    -   Publication language (i.e., English) -- A quick glance through the text will tell you whether the manuscript was published in English or not.
  
    -   Study setting (i.e., United States) -- The first or second paragraph of the Methods section will point out the setting or settings of the study. Typically it will be in the language about where study participants were recruited (e.g. a clinic, hospital, community in a particular city or state). Often this information may have its own section, such as "Study population" or "Participant recruitment". Look out for language like the below:
    
      > [we recruited] at 5 outpatient primary care clinics within the **Duke University Health System (DUHS)**

    -   Study type (see protocol for the full list of acceptable study types) -- There will typically be a paragraph (or cluster of sentences), that describe the study design. In some publications, it will be listed under its own section (e.g., **Study Design**). There will be language in there that quickly highlights the study type. For instance, you will see terms like "cluster randomized clinical trial" or "pre-post design". Such phrasing should give you an indication of the study type. 

2. The next criterion to consider is the **Study Population**. We want studies that have a population or a subpopulation that is hypertensive or living with hypertension.  However, in scenarios, a study could be looking at populations with chronic disease broadly or perhaps even cardiovascular disease. Hypertension is often a comorbidity of those two disease groups. Fortunately, the methods section will typically describe the study population 

3. The next criterion to consider are the study outcomes. There are four categories (<a href="https://butames.github.io/dphcmmsr/quicktips.html#study-outcomes">refer to previous material for their definitions</a>). 
-   Therapeutic Outcomes (e.g., hospitalizations, admission rates, blood pressure measurements)
-   Safety Outcomes (e.g., adverse reactions, )
-   Humanistic Outcomes (e.g., measures on quality of life, such as the quality-adjusted life year (QALY))
-   Economic Outcomes (e.g., cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, cost-benefit analyses)

The methods section will likely detail the important study outcomes, typically in a subsection with a heading such as, "Study Outcomes". The relevant outcome or outcomes will then be defined in succession with sentences beginning with words such as, "The primary outcome of interest is...". Many studies will also list secondary outcomes, with clear language. 

Occasionally, studies with many outcomes, some of them with numerous components, may list that information in table format. Consequently, be on the look out for a table of outcomes referenced in the **Methods Section** of a manuscript.

4. Finally consider whether the study matches the four components of an idean CMM intervention as defined in the protocol. Recall that CMM as we define it, has four components.
    -   Pharmacist-led or pharmacist involvement with team of care providers (e.g., physicians, nurses etc.).
    -   Development of a patient centered care plan.
    -   Evaluation of clinical status and medication review.
    -   Appropriate follow-up and evaluation

The intervention will be typically described in detail in the **Methods Section** There may even be a subsection, with the heading "Intervention Components" or language in that fashion. Utilize the search function to search for terms such as *intervention*.

Because of the possible complexity  CMM interventions, try not to worry about the finer details. We will capture that information during data extraction. However, do ensure that the intervention mentions **pharmacist involvement**, **a medication review**, and an indication of **follow-up** from the pharmacists/providers. I suspect manuscripts will touch on those three at the very least.
    

[^1]: I uploaded the documents separately, after searching for them individually through databases. While I tried to careful while uploading the manuscripts, I may have erred in a few cases. Consequently, a quick check of uploaded pdf document to make sure it aligns with the title/abstract information can help eliminate a minor errors.
